To address this, the FBI data notes which agencies have changed reporting practices each year and warns the crime figures are now \"not comparable to previous years\u2019 data.\" In the 2008 to 2017 period Sanfelippo referenced, the FBI flagged data from 46 Wisconsin municipalities as no longer being comparable to past years.

Toomey backed legislation to expand checks to online sales and gun shows \u2014 a position shared by Bloomberg, who helped launch the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety . A New York Times analysis of Bloomberg\u2019s donations stated that he spent $11.7 million to support Toomey in 2016. We used the database of donations posted by the Center for Responsive Politics and found that Bloomberg\u2019s Independence USA PAC spent $5.9 million in support of Toomey in 2016. At the beginning of 115th Congress in January 2017, there were 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and 2 independents who caucused with the Democrats. When Alabama Democrat Doug Jones took office in January 2018, that gave Republicans a 51-49 lead . If McGinty had won, the Senate would have ended up at 50-50. Washington University political scientist Steve Smith said that there are Senate precedents that allow the vice president\u2019s party \u2014 in this case Mike Pence \u2014 to be treated as the majority party. However the majority leader was the Republican leader. If the Senate found itself in another 50-50 split, that would lead to another round of negotiations. \"The Democrats would not control the Senate in the case of a 50-50 division,\" he said. If the vice president was Republican, the majority leader would be Republican.\" Senate vote on Kavanaugh Now that brings us to the part of the Facebook post that said after Jones won, if McGinty had also won, the Democrats \"could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court.\" This statement does have a qualifier of \"could,\" but if it assumes that a McGinty win alone could have changed the outcome. The Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh in October 2018. If we take the hypothetical scenario of McGinty beating Toomey, and assume she would have followed Democratic Party lines, and all other senators would have voted in the same way as they actually did, the vote would have tied 49-49. That means that Pence could have cast a deciding vote . Other scenarios are equally hypothetical.", "verdict": "NOT_SUPPORTED", "confidence": 0.85, "explanation": "While Mike Bloomberg did spend $11.7 million supporting Toomey, the evidence shows that even if McGinty had won, the Senate would still not have been controlled by Democrats outright due to a 50-50 split, with Vice President Pence breaking ties. This means Kavanaugh's confirmation could still be achieved."}}
