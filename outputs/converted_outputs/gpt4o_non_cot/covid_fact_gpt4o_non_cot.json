      "The Sheffield Community Contact Tracers team was created by a group of retired doctors and public health experts and began the local pilot in April after they became frustrated by the lack of government action on contact tracing.1 In a report,2 the team described the inability or unwillingness to engage by people working in health and care settings as a major challenge. They said that contact tracing may be resisted in workplaces, especially in the NHS and care homes, where contact tracing systems, social distancing of staff, and a culture supportive of self-isolation frequently does not exist. They also found that one in five of the initial patients responded to phone calls only after a physical message was hand deliveredsomething that the UK government may want to consider as it launches new NHS test and trace services."
