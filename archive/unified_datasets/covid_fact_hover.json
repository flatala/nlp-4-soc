      "September 21, 2020 LA JOLLA, CA --In a new study that demonstrates the promise of a novel vaccine approach for COVID-19, Scripps Research scientist Jiang Zhu, PhD, showed that his protein nanoparticle technology successfully triggered a strong immune response in mice.",
      "\"Our vaccine design enables immune cells to encounter these proteins in a more natural conformation--embedded on a spherical particle--so they'll know what to do when they face the virus in real life.\"",
      "The study, \" Self-assembling nanoparticles presenting receptor binding domain and stabilized spike as next-generation COVID-19 vaccines , \" was authored by Linling He, Xiaohe Lin, Ying Wang, Ciril Abraham, Cindy Sou, Timothy Ngo, Yi Zhang, Ian Wilson and Jiang Zhu."

      "Their newborns are at a higher risk of prematurity and early separation from their mothers, who may subsequently require intensive care for their own health.1,2 Although neonates born of mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy are seemingly vulnerable to infection, studies have found that they were not at a high risk for severe infection and were very rarely affected by COVID-19.1,2,3,4,5,6 The presence of virus by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been reported in newborns before H 12 of life.1 In addition, antiviral immunoglobulin M has been detected in newborns at birth,7 suggesting that mother-to-infant viral transmission may occur.8 To date, however, only one case of vertical transmission has been clearly demonstrated.9 In several cases of early neonatal infection, postnatal contamination cannot be excluded.10 Moreover, only one case report found that the virus could pass from mother to infant through the mothers breast milk.11 Despite these findings, international or national guidelines on the management of newborns of mothers suspected or positive for COVID-19, including Chinese consensus guidelines and guidelines of the American Academic of Pediatrics, have recommended at least temporary separation of mother and newborn as a precaution.12,13 In contrast, other guidelines,14 including those of the French Society of Neonatology,15,16 do not recommend systematic separation."
