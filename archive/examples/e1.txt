Claim: Stephen King wrote the novel that the movie directed by Stanley Kubrick that was sampled in the album \"Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest\" was based on.
Reasoning: Okay, I see the claim: "Stephen King wrote the novel that the movie directed by Stanley Kubrick that was sampled in the album Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest was based on." First, the album does sample The Shining. The film The Shining was directed by Stanley Kubrick, and it’s based on Stephen King’s novel, also called The Shining. So yes, the claim is fully supported.
Evidences: "Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest is the third full-length album released by metalcore band Zao on Solid State/Tooth & Nail. It was the first album to feature vocalist Dan Weyandt after the departure of Shawn Jonas along with new bassists/guitarists, Russ Cogdell and Brett Detar. The album contains a sample from the film \"The Shining\" at the beginning of \"To Think of You\", as well as a sample from the horror film \"The Prophecy\" during the intro to \"Ravage Ritual\".
