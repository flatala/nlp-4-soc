Claim: The English professional football club Ronnie Simpson was involved in, The Celtic Football Club, was founded in 1887.
Evidence: The Celtic Football Club ( ) is a professional football club based in Glasgow, Scotland, which plays in the Scottish Premiership. The club was founded in 1887 with the purpose of alleviating poverty in the immigrant Irish population in the East End of Glasgow. They played their first match in May 1888, a friendly match against Rangers which Celtic won 5â€“2. Celtic established itself within Scottish football, winning six successive league titles during the first decade of the 20th century. The club enjoyed their greatest successes during the 1960s and 70s under Jock Stein when they won nine consecutive league titles and the European Cup.
Reasoning: Alright, the claim suggests that Ronnie Simpson, a Scottish goalkeeper, was involved with Celtic Football Club, which is said to have been founded in 1887. First, I need to clarify that Celtic FC is indeed a Scottish club, not English. I also need to check if Simpson played for them. Lastly, the founding year of Celtic is 1887, so that part is correct. I'll need to carefully confirm these details, especially about Simpson's involvement.
