In a notice on its website — and this is what the Principia Scientific story quotes — the FDA said that amalgams contain mercury, which may have neurotoxic effects on the nervous systems of developing children and fetuses. \"Pregnant women and persons who may have a health condition that makes them more sensitive to mercury exposure, including individuals with existing high levels of mercury microburden, should not avoid seeking dental care, but should discuss options with their health practitioner,\" the FDA said.",
      "Based on the evidence, according to the agency, the FDA considers them safe for adults and children 6 and older. But fetuses and young children may be more sensitive to the \"neurotoxic effects of mercury vapor,\" according to the FDA. It says there is \"very limited to no\" clinical data on the long-term health outcomes for pregnant women, their fetuses and young children, and advises concerned patients to talk to their dentists. The agency also discourages patients from removing their dental amalgams if they’re in good condition and there’s no tooth decay under the filling because, in part, it could expose that person to additional mercury vapor released during the removal process."

      "Definitions a moving target So Thiesfeldt’s argument is that proficiency = grade level. But it’s tricky equating it to proficiency since the definition of proficient has changed over time in Wisconsin. In the past, the term was indeed roughly equivalent to what many consider grade level, said Alan Borsuk , a senior fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University Law School and longtime education reporter and columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. But that changed in 2013 when Wisconsin dramatically raised the achievement level needed to reach the \"proficient\" threshold. Can it still be equated to grade level as Thiesfeldt does? \"The answer is quite emphatically no,\" Borsuk said. He elaborated in his Sept. 13, 2019, Journal Sentinel column . \"I’m increasingly willing to lump ‘basic’ with ‘proficient’ and ‘advanced’ to get a rough measure of whether kids are on grade level,\" Borsuk wrote. \"And if you do that, you come up with — to give one example — about three-quarters for Wisconsin public school students in third through eighth grade rated as basic or better in English language arts (often just called reading), which certainly looks better than saying well below half are proficient.\" Tom Loveless , a former senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who authored the group’s annual report on education trends for 16 years, said he agreed with Borsuk that a basic rating on the state’s assessment system tests is roughly equal to what the proficient rating was years ago.",

Daily Politics Feed, the YouTube channel responsible for the video, says all of its videos are created by transcribing the text of stories from \"alternative news sources.\" The Illicit Info article is labeled as opinion. \"It was a loan guarantee to a company with a very small investment from a firm Ronald Pelosi joined after the deal in which he had no financial stake or benefit,\" the spokesperson said, noting that Ronald Pelosi is Nancy Pelosi’s brother-in-law, not brother, as the video says. Several fact-checkers and news outlets have set the record straight since the deal was announced in 2011, including FactCheck.org , Snopes , the San Francisco Chronicle and Fortune . Each of them found that Ronald Pelosi’s connection to SolarReserve, the parent company of the firm that received the loan for a project in Nevada, was blown out of proportion. According to those reports, the unsubstantiated claims first popped up shortly after the Energy Department announced in September 2011 that it would be providing a $737 loan guarantee to Tonopah Solar Energy, a subsidiary of SolarReserve, for a major solar project. At the time of the announcement, Ronald Pelosi was an \"independent director\" on the board of PCG Asset Management, a subsidiary of a private equity firm called Pacific Corporate Group, which had invested in SolarReserve, according to FactCheck.org . The $737 million sent to Tonopah Solar Energy was a loan guarantee, not a blank check, and SolarReserve told FactCheck.org and Snopes that Pacific Corporate Group’s investment was a 2% share. Pelosi also provided FactCheck.org with documentation showing that he took in just $25,000 annually from his role on the board. Plus, Ronald Pelosi wasn’t on the board at the time that Pacific Corporate Group made its investment in SolarReserve, according to the San Francisco Chronicle . The Chronicle reported that Pelosi didn’t stand to profit from the firm’s stake in SolarReserve, either."

      "Newer data available Asked for evidence supporting his discussion of violent crime, Sanfelippo’s office pointed us to a policy brief the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum published in December 2019. But the 2018 data, which was available at the time,  shows a noteworthy reversal, with the violent crime rate dropping after several years of steady increases. To address this, the FBI data notes which agencies have changed reporting practices each year and warns the crime figures are now \"not comparable to previous years’ data.\" In the 2008 to 2017 period Sanfelippo referenced, the FBI flagged data from 46 Wisconsin municipalities as no longer being comparable to past years. That included three of the 10 largest cities — which you’ll remember Sanfelippo cited specifically as having a 24% increase in violent crime. Using FBI crime data from 2008 and 2018 and removing the places that changed reporting practices in that span leaves us with 206 municipalities — still a solid sample size. Based on that group, the statewide violent crime rate rose from 4.3 to 4.7 per 1,000 residents from 2008 to 2018. But Milwaukee accounted for all of that change. Remove Milwaukee and the crime rate across the other 205 municipalities went from 1.77 per 1,000 to 1.74 per 1,000 — virtually unchanged. The memo said — again, based in part on data the FBI warned against comparing — that violent crime rates increased in all but two of the state’s 10 largest cities. Sanfelippo instead claimed the crime rate increased in \"all but two Wisconsin cities.\" That’s not even close to true. Using the 206 municipalities referenced above — those that have data for both 2008 and 2018 and haven’t changed reporting practices — we find the crime rate rose in 98 municipalities, fell in 88 and was unchanged in 20. Sanfelippo acknowledged using the stat incorrectly when questioned by PolitiFact Wisconsin."

Some outlets, like Lead Stories , knocked down posts claiming white vans with external locks are the vehicle of choice for sex traffickers, noting that such locks are widely available for sale online and commonly used by workers who use expensive tools on the job. These posts reportedly took off after Baltimore Mayor Jack Young issued a warning about white vans that he claimed, without evidence, were \"trying to snatch up young girls for human trafficking.\" Young said he got word of such incidents from Facebook rather than from the Baltimore Police Department, which later told reporters it had no reports of actual incidents that involved sex traffickers driving white vans with external locks.

That was enough to rank him as the 12th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes . The Sanders campaign’s source is a column by Matt Bruenig of the People’s Policy Project , a think tank that has \"a special focus on socialist and social democratic economic ideas.\" Bruenig was more specific than Sanders, writing that by his calculation of Federal Reserve \"summary extract public data ,\" Bloomberg owns nearly six times as much wealth as the bottom 38% of households. When we contacted Bruenig, he said he used the Federal Reserve’s Summary Extract Public Data , which is offered for researchers to make calculations using statistical software. Bruenig said he sorted all households from those with the least wealth to those with the most wealth. He then added the wealth of the bottom 38% of American households to get $11.4 billion. Then, he determined how many household units this accounted for and found the answer to be 47.8 million. You can then multiply the 47.8 million households by 2.63 (the average number of people per household ) to come up with 125.7 million people. Matthew Gross, a doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan with data-analyzing experience, helped PolitiFact replicate Bruenig’s math. Gross found that the bottom 38% had about $6 billion in wealth, rather than Bruenig’s $11.4 billion, but either way, this was enough to verify the calculation that Bloomberg had more wealth than the bottom 38% of American households combined. Meanwhile, he found that the 38th percentile alone owns about $50 billion. Together, then, percentiles 0 through 38 collectively own about $6 billion in wealth, which is less than Bloomberg had. In a technical sense, however, tens of millions of Americans join Bloomberg in owning more wealth than the bottom 37% of households combined, since the bottom 37% are collectively in the red."

Changes to Wisconsin’s voter rolls When asked for evidence for Klobuchar’s claim, a staffer pointed to a 2018 report from the left-leaning Center for Media and Democracy that indicated nearly 700,000 voters had been removed from the rolls since 2016. To meet a requirement under state law, the commission in 2017 removed more than 351,000 voters who hadn’t voted in four years and didn’t respond to a mailed notice to continue their registrations. Then, in 2018, the commission canceled the registrations of more than 300,000 voters after the agency’s Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, identified voters who had become inactive or needed to update their registration.

      "\"I take it that this is a printout of the Trump speech, in which case it is absurd to suggest that Pelosi can be prosecuted for doing with it whatever she pleases,\" said Heidi Kitrosser, professor of law at University of Minnesota. Since our fact-check of Kirk, Snopes and other news outlets have also concluded that Pelosi did not violate the law. So has Jonathan Turley , the George Washington University law professor who testified against impeaching Trump in the House Judiciary Committee. Even Fox News host Laura Ingraham, whose on-air commentary is typically pro-Trump, knocked the idea in an interview with Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who filed an ethics complaint against Pelosi. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The federal statute in question sets a penalty for anyone who \"conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys\" any government record \"filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States.\" The statute also says that any person with \"custody\" of a government record cannot \"willfully and unlawfully\" conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, falsify or destroy it. Experts told us Pelosi’s move was not illegal because her copy of Trump’s speech wasn’t the official government record that would need to be preserved. The State of the Union text was never \"filed or deposited\" with her, nor did she have \"custody\" of it in the legal sense. Trump handed her and Vice President Mike Pence copies before he began speaking. (AP) \"Her copy of the State of the Union address is not a government record or government property at all,\" Douglas Cox, professor of law at the City University of New York School of Law and an expert in the laws on the preservation of government records, told us. \"It is personal property.\" Under House rules , members of Congress are encouraged to preserve their records or donate them to a research institution for historical study, Cox said. There are probably countless copies of Trump’s address, such as the version the White House posted online. Pelosi’s action did not preclude future generations from accessing one."

The school puts it like this : \"Think of droplets as small bits of fluid that you can see and feel when someone sneezes. You sneeze or cough and these droplets get on surfaces and then you touch them and get them on your hands, or they can fly right into your mouth or nose or eyes. That’s how most coronaviruses are transmitted and that’s how we think this one is too.\" Now consider an aerosol — like hairspray. You may still be able to smell it a while after someone has used it because it’s lingering in the air, according to the school: \"Obviously we’re learning a lot about this virus, but most coronaviruses aren’t airborne this way.

      "Falling back on old votes When asked to provide evidence for Gallagher’s claim, his press secretary Jordan Dunn pointed to the same three House roll call votes that Gallagher’s colleague from southeastern Wisconsin, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, used to make a claim about impeachment about a week earlier. Like Sensenbrenner, Gallagher’s office claimed that lawmakers who voted \"no\" on the motion to table the impeachment measure were actually casting a \"yes\" vote on impeachment. \"In voting to oppose tabling a measure, that is literally an expression of support for continuing consideration of a measure,\" said Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, in an email. Though one can surely argue at least some Democrats were convinced Trump had committed impeachable offenses before the Ukraine call, no one cast an \"impeachment vote\" until Dec. 18. That’s when Trump was impeached over allegations he withheld aid to Ukraine and asked the country to open an investigation into the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. So Gallagher is off point on the first part of the claim. At a Sept. 23, 2017 campaign rally in Huntsville, Ala., the president said :  \"Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he’s fired? He’s fired!’\" But Green’s resolution admonished Trump for \"inciting hate and hostility, and sowing discord among the people of the United States on the basis of race and gender,\" not for chastising the football league itself. Indeed, in May 2018, when the NFL released a policy warning that players who protested during the national anthem would face consequences, Trump commended the league. Moreover, that paragraph was just one of 11 instances Green cited as examples of why the president should be impeached."

In sum, fines based on consumption will be administered to the water agencies that fail to meet their goals, not to individuals who use too much water in their daily lives.

Using the same set of tax data, researchers at Stanford’s conservative Hoover Institution found a larger increase in the rate of departures among top earners after 2012. Their report defined a departing taxpayer more broadly than Young and his colleague did and did not address net migration. Meanwhile, reports by California’s nonpartisan legislative research arm and the Sacramento Bee have found that since the early 2000s, the state has gained rather than lost residents making over $100,000."

Toomey backed legislation to expand checks to online sales and gun shows — a position shared by Bloomberg, who helped launch the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety . A New York Times analysis of Bloomberg’s donations stated that he spent $11.7 million to support Toomey in 2016. We used the database of donations posted by the Center for Responsive Politics and found that Bloomberg’s Independence USA PAC spent $5.9 million in support of Toomey in 2016. At the beginning of 115th Congress in January 2017, there were 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and 2 independents who caucused with the Democrats. When Alabama Democrat Doug Jones took office in January 2018, that gave Republicans a 51-49 lead . If McGinty had won, the Senate would have ended up at 50-50. Washington University political scientist Steve Smith said that there are Senate precedents that allow the vice president’s party — in this case Mike Pence — to be treated as the majority party. However the majority leader was the Republican leader. If the Senate found itself in another 50-50 split, that would lead to another round of negotiations. \"The Democrats would not control the Senate in the case of a 50-50 division,\" he said.

The Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh in October 2018. If we take the hypothetical scenario of McGinty beating Toomey, and assume she would have followed Democratic Party lines, and all other senators would have voted in the same way as they actually did, the vote would have tied 49-49.

      "To be clear: killing an infant after birth is illegal, and people on both sides of the abortion debate agree that this act should be illegal. Under federal law, the definitions of a person, human being, child and individual all include infants \"born alive at any stage of development.\" In Virginia, a woman can choose to obtain an abortion through the end of the second trimester of pregnancy, up to 28 weeks from her last menstrual period. The bill Virginia lawmakers considered in 2019 proposed multiple changes to state laws addressing abortion, including the provision regulating the procedure in the third trimester. The proposal would have lowered the number of physicians required to authorize a third-trimester abortion from three to one and remove the \"substantial and irremediable\" threshold in the law. But days later, Tran said she misspoke : \"I should have said: ‘Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.’\" A spokeswoman for Cruz pointed to the language of Tran’s bill and said it clearly allows abortion up until the moment of birth, but Tran’s bill only changed the requirements in place before a doctor can perform a third-trimester abortion. Virginia law prohibits \"partial birth infanticide,\" the killing of an infant who has \"been born alive, but who has not been completely extracted or expelled from its mother.\" Northam rejected this characterization of his remarks and a spokesperson said the comments were about options for care available to women with a nonviable pregnancy or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality. In these cases, where there is \"little or no prospect\" of an infant surviving after birth, families might opt for perinatal palliative care , or comfort care — prioritizing comfort while allowing an infant to die naturally without exercising full resuscitation efforts. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes this care as existing on a spectrum of care, \"which includes pregnancy termination (abortion) and full neonatal resuscitation and treatment.\" This type of care is rare — a study of deaths at children’s hospitals found that while neonates represented 41% of all deaths, perinatal palliative care was only utilized in 2% of cases — and does not meet the definition of abortion."

The Vermont senator received $2,910,894, while the former South Bend mayor trailed closely behind with $2,713,038.

In the health care industry categories of hospitals/nursing homes and health professionals , Sanders has received the most in dollar contributions. When asked to clarify how the Sanders campaign is defining the health care industry, a staffer responded that \"Bernie Sanders issued a pledge to not accept money from top officials of the insurance and pharmaceutical industries (as distinct from rank-and-file workers in those industries, which the aggregate data you cite deals with).

    "label": "NOT_SUPPORTED",
    "evidences": [
      "Christopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University, helped make sense of some of the figures. He calculated the average, 10-year mortality rate for flu using CDC data and found it was 0.1%. That 0.1% rate is frequently cited among experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. According to statistics released Feb. 17 by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the mortality rate for coronavirus was 2.3%. That’s based on cases reported through Feb. 11 and calculated by dividing the numbers of coronavirus-related deaths at the time (1,023) by the number of the confirmed cases (44,672) of the coronavirus. But this report has limitations, Mores said, including the vague way Chinese officials are defining who has been infected by the coronavirus. \"We have not been able to understand what precisely has gone on there,\" said Mores. The WHO said in a press conference Monday that in Wuhan, China, the city where the virus first hit, the mortality rate ranged from 2% to 4%. Officials said that in the rest of China, outside of Wuhan, the mortality rate of coronavirus is 0.7%. Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the mortality rate in China has since risen to 0.9%. Right now he doesn’t see a similarity in the flu mortality rate and the coronavirus mortality rate. Multiple experts told us that the number of coronavirus cases not just in China but worldwide has probably been undercounted because many people with the infection do not suffer serious symptoms and may not seek medical treatment. It is possible that only those who have tested positive are being counted as \"confirmed cases.\" Until the case definition is expanded, they said, to include people clinicians think may have COVID-19 but who were not tested for it, then the total estimated number of cases will remain lower than the likely reality. But, if the number of cases widens to include those with mild symptoms who have not been tested, then the mortality rate will go down. This is the way mortality rates are calculated for the flu, said Mores. The numbers of flu illnesses and deaths are estimates based not only on positive flu tests, but also on doctors’ suspicions and symptomatic diagnosis."

      "\"He fired the pandemic team two years ago\" \"Fired\" may be a strong word, but there have been abrupt changes to key national security posts with responsibility for global pandemics. More recently the administration has assigned new officials to take leadership roles. In May 2018, the top White House official in charge of the U.S. response to pandemics left the administration . After Ziemer’s departure, the global health team was reorganized as part of an effort by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton. Meanwhile, Tom Bossert, a homeland security adviser who recommended strong defenses against disease and biological warfare, was reportedly pushed out by Bolton in 2018. Neither White House official or their teams, which were responsible for coordinating the U.S. response to pandemic outbreaks across agencies, have been replaced during the past two years. And on Feb. 18, 2020, a group of 27 senators sent a letter to current National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien to ask him to appoint a new global health security expert to the NSC. \"The fact that they explicitly dismantled the office in the White House that was tasked with preparing for exactly this kind of a risk is hugely concerning,\" Jeremy Konyndyk, who ran foreign disaster assistance in the Obama administration, told the Guardian . \"Both the structure and all the institutional memory is gone now.\" Instead, Trump has looked within his administration to fill roles for the coronavirus response. Last month, Trump appointed his Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar, to chair a coronavirus task force. It’s not accurate to say that Trump has been \"defunding\" the CDC, but he has tried to make cuts in key programs. The Trump administration’s initial proposals for the budgets for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases at CDC — a key player in the fight against coronavirus — have consistently been lower than what was spent the previous year. The administration proposed $61.7 million less in 2018 than 2017; $96.4 million less in 2019 than in 2018; $114.4 million less in 2020 than in 2019; and $85.3 million less in 2021 than 2020. However, Congress reshapes presidential recommendations as they see fit when they craft final spending bills. Every year since Trump has been president, lawmakers have passed bills — bills signed by Trump — that not only exceeded what Trump requested on emerging infections but also exceeded what had been spent the previous year.

      "During the Nixon and Clinton impeachment hearings, the majority and minority parties could seek subpoenas, and both of them could lodge an objection to the other’s request.

In contrast, the rule approved for the Trump impeachment effectively says the Democrats can object to a Republican request, but the Republicans can’t object to a Democratic one. The business of \"either shall have the right\" is missing in the current rules. \"Under the Clinton and Nixon rules, it was symmetrical,\" said Stanford law professor Dave Alan Sklansky. \"Now there’s an asymmetry.\" But again, both then and now, if it comes to a committee vote, the majority will get what it wants.

His office told us \"the concern is that current chairmen are not respecting\" standing House rules. The Democratic materials say nothing about this one way or the other. Compared with the Nixon process , lawmakers imposed strict limits on who could see what. Clinton’s lawyers did participate in the Judiciary Committee process, and the House resolution gives Trump’s lawyers the same rights for that committee. However, Cole has a point that Trump’s lawyers can’t participate in the House committees currently investigating the president, most importantly, the Select Intelligence Committee. In the Trump investigation, Republicans on the Intelligence Committee can call witnesses and ask questions. They don’t have the same powers as the majority, but they have the right to participate and represent Trump’s interests.

Bloomberg’s claim wasn’t limited to Texas, but this trend is also visible at the state level. A 2018 report from the CDC looked at infant mortality data from 2013 to 2015 by state and race and found that, in Texas, the mortality rate for infants born to non-Hispanic white women was 5 deaths per 1,000 live births and was 10.52 for infants born to black women. The five leading causes of all infant deaths in 2017 identified by the CDC were all health related: Congenital malformations: 21% of infant deaths Disorders related to short gestation and low birthweight: 17% of infant deaths Maternal complications: 6% of infant deaths Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): 6% of infant deaths Unintentional injuries: 6% of infant deaths In a 2019 report, the CDC noted that infants born to black women had the highest mortality rates for disorders related to short gestation (premature birth) and low birthweight and maternal complications. Numerous academic studies and media investigations have highlighted correlations between access to health care and the disparity in infant and maternal mortality rates between black and white mothers. But access to health care is widely considered to be one of many contributing factors. One 2017 study published in the American Journal of Public Health identified other factors that contribute to the high black infant mortality rate: socioeconomic status, maternal behavior, \"exposure to protective and risk factors over the course of a woman’s life,\" and certain historical factors like segregation, limited educational opportunities, structural racism, and intergenerational poverty.

The fact sheet, among other things, showed 43% of Medicaid enrollees report their health as excellent or very good compared with 71% of people with private insurance, 14% on Medicare and 58% who were uninsured. The spokesperson also pointed to a 2017 report by the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC), a congressional advisory board, that noted: \"Medicaid enrollees have more difficulty than low-income privately insured individuals in finding a doctor who accepts their insurance and making an appointment; Medicaid enrollees also have more difficulty finding a specialist physician who will treat them.\" Several national Medicaid experts said Verma is wrong to use health status as a proxy for whether Medicaid helps improve health for people. That’s because to be eligible for Medicaid, people must fall into a low-income bracket, which can impact their health in many ways. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard University, said Verma’s comparison of the health status of Medicaid recipients against people with Medicare or private insurance is invalid because the populations are so different and face varied health risks. For a better mechanism to gauge health outcomes under Medicaid, experts point to dozens of studies that track what happened in states that chose in the past six years to pursue the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion. \"Most research demonstrates that Medicaid expansion has improved access to care, utilization of services, the affordability of care, and financial security among the low-income population,\" concluded the Kaiser Family Foundation in summarizing findings from more than 300 studies. \"Studies show improved self-reported health following expansion and an association between expansion and certain positive health outcomes.\" Studies found the expansion of Medicaid led to lower mortality rates for people with heart disease and among end-stage renal disease patients initiating dialysis . Researchers also reported that Medicaid expansion was associated with declines in the length of stay of hospitalized patients. A 2017 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found 84% of Medicaid recipients felt they were able to get all the medical care they needed in the previous six months. Only 3% said they could not get care because of long wait times or because doctors would not accept their insurance. Verma cites a 2017 MACPAC report that noted some people on Medicaid have issues accessing care. But that report also noted: \"The body of work to date by MACPAC and others shows that Medicaid beneficiaries have much better access to care, and much higher health care utilization, than individuals without insurance, particularly when controlling for socioeconomic characteristics and health status.\" It also notes that \"Medicaid beneficiaries also fare as well as or better than individuals with private insurance on some access measures.\" The report said people with Medicaid are as likely as those with private insurance to have a usual source of care, a doctor visit each year and certain services such as a Pap test to detect cervical cancer. On the negative side, the report said Medicaid recipients are more likely than privately insured patients to experience longer waiting times to see a doctor. They also are less likely to receive mammograms, colorectal tests and dental visits than the privately insured. \"Compared to having no insurance at all, having Medicaid improves access to care and improves health,\" said Rachel Garfield, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"There is pretty strong evidence that Medicaid helps patients get the care they need.\""

      "In July 2019, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a news release about proposed new rules for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps. The release said the proposed rule \"would fix a loophole that has expanded SNAP recipients in some states to include people who receive assistance when they clearly don’t need it.\" Reviews of their income and assets would need to be conducted to ensure that, in most cases, their income is at or below 130% of the federal poverty level and they do not have liquid assets worth more than $2,250. For a family of three, 130% of the federal poverty level is about $2,250 a month. Nationwide, the proposal is expected to save $2.5 billion and cut benefits to about 3 million people. The evidence When asked to provide backup, Grothman’s staff pointed us to several news articles, including a Sept. 16, 2019 report from the Washington Examiner that reminded readers about the case of Leroy Fick who continued to receive food stamps after winning $2 million in the Michigan State Lottery in 2010. \"Fick used his winnings to buy a new home and an Audi convertible, all while continuing to receive SNAP benefits,\" the Examiner article said. At the time, Michigan used federal guidelines that based eligibility for food stamps solely on income. The state considered Fick’s $850,000 lump sum lottery payment an asset -- not income. So, under state policy then in effect, Fick could legally get food stamps. The state subsequently banned anyone with assets of more than $5,000, excluding a car, from the food stamp program. That ban knocked Fick off the food stamp rolls. Cloud (Minn.) Times, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, Undersander said he and his wife have a net worth that \"exceeds $1 million.\" In that and other accounts, he said he wanted to expose a loophole that would allow people who are wealthy, or at least those not needy, to qualify for food stamps.

He was compensated $500,000. Hillary Clinton \"sold 20% of US Uranium to Russia\" This is misleading. Its actual production, though, is a smaller portion of the uranium produced in the United States, at 11% in 2014, according to Oilprice.com.

It’s a preliminary estimate that is on very shaky ground.\" The CBO estimates that, over the next decade, between eight and 15 fewer drugs would come to market. But the big picture matters: Every year, the Food and Drug Administration approves 30 new drugs, on average. That’s 300 new drugs over 10 years. So if you assume 15 fewer drugs out of 300 projected approvals, that’s a loss of 5%. Certainly that is, as PhRMA argued, a reduction.

In fact, she said, \"there is a good reason to believe that the drugs you would lose are those that have the smallest benefit and highest price tag.\" This gets at another point: A substantial portion of drug research and development isn’t actually done by drugmakers. The riskiest portions often are conducted in government-funded labs, noted Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor at Harvard Medical School who studies pharmaceutical policy. Drug companies get involved much later, making it even less certain that a loss in pharmaceutical revenue would meaningfully discourage breakthrough drug innovation. Other arguments PhRMA also pointed us to a Dec. 3 report put out by the White House Council of Economic Advisers . It found a much higher impact ― arguing that H.R.3 would result in \"as many as 100 fewer drugs\" entering the American market in the next 10 years. The CEA number rests on a series of assumptions.

Similarly, a mid July Marist poll conducted in partnership with NPR and PBS NewsHour asked 1,346 respondents about \"background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales.\" And 82% of \"2016 Trump supporters\" said the checks were a \"good idea.\" Small sample sizes could be misleading, even if a larger number of polls shows high support for background checks among Republicans more generally.

    "evidences": [
      "We contacted the surgeon general’s office, which directed us to statements from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. NIDA noted that marijuana may have a gateway effect, but that most people who use the drug don’t progress to other, harder substances; and that alcohol and nicotine appear to have a similar impact. The idea that marijuana can \"prime your brain for addiction\" has some basis: namely, the results of some studies conducted with rodents. For instance, Adams’ office noted that preclinical studies indicate exposure to THC – marijuana’s main psychoactive compound –  during a period roughly equivalent to adolescence in rats resulted in greater self-administration of heroin when the animals reach adulthood. In addition, THC exposure yielded changes in their brains’ reward system – in other words, yes, priming the brain for the rewarding effects of opioids. But, Isen said, it’s scientifically problematic to draw a line from the effects seen in rodents to what might be happening to a human. \"We should remain agnostic about the surgeon general’s claim,\" Isen argued. Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa., took a more optimistic view of that research, arguing that the animal evidence is \"very clear\" when it comes to marijuana’s neurological impact. \"What we know is strong enough to say that exposure during adolescence when the brain is developing is a risk,\" said Susan Weiss, a scientific adviser to the NIDA director. But how meaningful of a risk – and how it compares to other drugs – is exceptionally tough to say, given the limitations on research. Studies on actual humans are limited because people who use marijuana at a young age may be exposed to other risk factors, such as peer influences using harder drugs, or sociodemographic factors that might predispose them to abuse or addiction. As Dr. Sue Sisley, an Arizona-based psychiatrist who tracks the state of marijuana research, put it: \"I don’t see very much good, rigorous data to confirm either way.\" In the most narrow sense, marijuana indeed has a \"unique\" effect on the brain. It elicits a response from what are called \"endocannabinoid receptors.\" Other drugs don’t – they interact with different brain receptors. On a practical level, Isen said, while one could highlight the distinct scientific effect marijuana has, \"there is no evidence that marijuana has a uniquely deleterious effect on the developing brain - certainly not more than other substances such as alcohol.\""

He suggests many Americans would be able to pick between buying private insurance or opting into the government plan. But does that mean that if you like your plan, you can keep it? The problem is that private insurance availability isn’t up to the government. To be sure, state and federal regulators have the power to dictate, for example, the inclusion of certain benefits and to set basic consumer protections. But the government cannot specifically require insurance companies to offer plans, and any carrier has the option to stop providing coverage. Already, market forces dictate what health insurance is available from year to year. It’s impossible to predict, but a competing public option might change the financial incentives for those plans and push some of those carriers to abandon the exchange.

From a narrow perspective, Pocan is off — an offer of $12.75 does not equate to hourly wages from 30 years ago, as a straight comparison or with inflation factored in. He fares much better when considering the larger point being made: That wage growth has been largely stagnant. An August 2018 study from the Pew Research Center showed that at least since 2000, most of the country’s wage growth is distributed among the top 10% of earners. For those closer to the median and below it, the growth line is nearly flat. What’s more, the cost of living has undergone a much steeper hike: from 1983 to 2013, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a roughly 3% annual increase in rent and food prices, and a 1.3% annual increase in new vehicle prices.

Biden assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine after a popular revolution in early 2014 that led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Shokin became top prosecutor in 2015, after Yanukovych went into exile. A frustrated Biden in Dec. 2015 threatened to withhold $1 billion unless Shokin was fired, in hopes that a new prosecutor would do more to enforce the law. According to Biden, it worked. When Shokin was fired in the spring of 2016, press reports explicitly linked his ouster to corruption. Steven Pifer, a career foreign service officer who held positions in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, previously told PolitiFact that \"virtually everyone\" he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine \"felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired.\" \"All decent people were in favor of Shokin's sacking,\" Anders Åslund, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council told PolitiFact. \"Biden led a Western/anticorruption consensus.\" Recently, Shokin said in a statement that his refusal to formally close the investigations led to his ouster.

In his Nickelback video, Trump showed a clip of Biden saying he had \"never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\" contrasting that with the photograph of the golf group. That’s different than claiming he had never spoken to Burisma. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker magazine in July 2019 that he discussed Burisma with his father one time in December 2015."

Okaloosa County Deputy Chris Anglin clocked Gaetz traveling 48 mph in a 35 mph. Anglin reported that Gaetz’s eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he swayed and staggered when he got out of the car and smelled of alcohol.

We did not find evidence that Gaetz’s father Don \"got him off\" of the arrest, as the post says. Gaetz’s lawyer filed a motion to drop the case.

      "The claim has roots in an Oct. 22 article from the Washington Times , which said that under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Democrats have issued 56 subpoenas while passing just 46 bills that went on to become laws. But while other Republicans specified that the Washington Times article counted congressional subpoenas against House bills that were ultimately signed into law, Shields was less precise, instead comparing subpoenas issued to bills passed. In fact, House Democrats have helped pass more than 500 bills and resolutions, although many have not made their way to Trump’s desk. When we reached out to Shields, he said he \"misspoke,\" and he later clarified his point on Twitter . \"I meant to say more subpoenas than laws that have been passed, not bills,\" he told us. Experts said it’s meaningless to compare subpoenas with House bills enacted into law, because while a committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, there are more hurdles when it comes to legislation. The House can’t make laws by itself Experts said the biggest problem with the subpoenas-to-bills comparison is the lack of attention it pays to the Senate’s role in sending House-backed bills to the president’s desk. \"The House can't pass ‘bills into law’ by itself,\" said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. According to Congress.gov , the House has passed or agreed to 522 bills and resolutions since January. \"We are talking about two completely different processes,\" said Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, a Washington think tank. \"A committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, whereas it takes a majority of House members and senators to enact a law."

The new numbers showed between 2015 and 2016, the Obama administration had an average business investment growth of 0.7%.

Under the full eight years of the Obama administration, the rate of business investment growth was about 3.7%. When bringing Trump’s term to the overall latest numbers, overall growth has been about 4.9%. Tara Sinclair, an economics professor at George Washington University, said average growth rates for business investment look stronger in recent years, but when measured as a share of Gross Domestic Product the picture is very similar under both administrations. Sinclair said GOP policies that cut regulations may have helped lead to stronger business investment under the Trump administration, but it’s hard to blame or credit a presidential administration for most economic outcomes. \"As you can see from the data, the quarterly growth rates are quite volatile, so more data to identify a clear trend will be helpful,\" Sinclair told us."

      "But it’s an over-simplification of a nuanced issue. Some states — including California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington — require all private sales be conducted through firearm dealers, who then retain sales records, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence , a research and advocacy organization. Other states give private sellers the option of going through law enforcement directly for the background check. The record-keeping requirements vary, with some states leaving that to the individual selling the gun and others requiring transfers be reported to local law enforcement. The state Department of Justice handles background checks for handgun sales , while long gun sales go through the National Criminal Background Check Systems , run by the FBI. The FBI conducts the background check but is required by federal law to destroy identifying information on the purchaser and gun within 24 hours. So under a comprehensive system, serial numbers would — eventually — make it to a government agency. But it is typically decades before that happens, and the agency is then prohibited from turning those into a database. Would a gun registry violate the Second Amendment? Courts have said that isn’t true. \"These state laws have been in place for decades and have not been overturned on the grounds that they violate an individual’s Second Amendment rights,\" said Daniel Webster , director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research."
