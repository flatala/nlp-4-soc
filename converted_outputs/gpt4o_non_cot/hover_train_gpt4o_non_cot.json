      "MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City.

In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, particularly high school and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods.

      "A substorm, sometimes referred to as a magnetospheric substorm or an auroral substorm, is a brief disturbance in the Earth's magnetosphere that causes energy to be released from the \"tail\" of the magnetosphere and injected into the high latitude ionosphere. Visually, a substorm is seen as a sudden brightening and increased movement of auroral arcs. Substorms were first described in qualitative terms by Kristian Birkeland which he called polar elementary storms. Sydney Chapman used the term substorm about 1960 which is now the standard term. The morphology of aurora during of a substorm was first described by Syun-Ichi Akasofu in 1964 using data collected during the International Geophysical Year.",

He is best remembered as the person whose theories of atmospheric electric currents elucidated the nature of the aurora borealis. In order to fund his research on the aurorae, he invented the electromagnetic cannon and the Birkeland-Eyde process of fixing nitrogen from the air.

      "Rotating bolt is a method of locking used in firearms. Johann Nicolaus von Dreyse developed the first rotating bolt firearm, the \"Dreyse needle gun\" in 1836. The Dreyse locked using the bolt handle rather than lugs on the bolt head like the Mauser M 98 or M16. The first rotating bolt rifle with two lugs on the bolt head was the Lebel Model 1886 rifle. The concept has been implemented on most firearms chambered for high powered cartridges since the 20th century.",
      "The Lebel Model 1886 rifle (French: Fusil Modèle 1886 dit \"Fusil Lebel\") is also known as the \"Fusil Mle 1886 M93\", after a bolt modification was added in 1893. It is an 8 mm bolt action infantry rifle that entered service in the French Army in 1887. It is a repeating rifle that can hold eight rounds in its forestock tube magazine, one round in the transporter plus one round in the chamber. The Lebel rifle has the distinction of being the first military firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition. The new propellant powder, \"\"Poudre B\",\" was nitrocellulose-based and had been invented in 1884 by French chemist Paul Vieille. Lieutenant Colonel Nicolas Lebel contributed a flat nosed 8 mm full metal jacket bullet (\"\"Balle M\",\" or \"\"Balle Lebel\"\"). Twelve years later, in 1898, a solid brass pointed (spitzer) and boat-tail bullet called \"\"Balle D\"\" was retained for all 8mm Lebel ammunition. Each case was protected against accidental percussion inside the tube magazine by a primer cover and by a circular groove around the primer cup which caught the tip of the following pointed bullet. Featuring an oversized bolt with front locking lugs and a massive receiver, the Lebel rifle was a durable design capable of long range performance. In spite of early obsolete features, such as its tube magazine and the shape of 8mm Lebel rimmed ammunition, the Lebel rifle remained the basic weapon of French line infantry during World War I (1914–1918). Altogether, 3.45 million Lebel rifles were produced by the three French state factories between 1887 and 1916."

Sailor Ishmael tells the story of the obsessive quest of Ahab, captain of the whaler \"Pequod\", for revenge on Moby Dick, the white whale that on the previous whaling voyage bit off Ahab's leg at the knee. The novel was a commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891, but during the 20th century, its reputation as a Great American Novel was established. William Faulkner confessed he wished he had written it himself, and D. H. Lawrence called it \"one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world\", and \"the greatest book of the sea ever written\". \"Call me Ishmael\" is among world literature's most famous opening sentences."

In reaction to the sacking of Lawrence, Kansas by pro-slavery forces, John Brown and a band of abolitionist settlers—some of them members of the Pottawatomie Rifles—killed five settlers north of Pottawatomie Creek in Franklin County, Kansas. This was one of the many bloody episodes in Kansas preceding the American Civil War, which came to be known collectively as Bleeding Kansas. Bleeding Kansas was largely brought about by the Missouri Compromise and the Kansas–Nebraska Act."

      "\"Highwayman\" is a song written by American singer-songwriter Jimmy Webb, about a soul with incarnations in four different places in time and history: as a highwayman, a sailor, a construction worker on the Hoover Dam, and finally as a captain of a starship. The song was influenced by the real-life hanged highwayman Jonathan Wild. The dam builder verse alludes to the deaths of over one hundred men during the construction of Hoover Dam near Boulder City, Nevada. Webb first recorded the song on his album \"El Mirage\", released in May 1977. The following year, Glen Campbell recorded his version, which was released on his 1979 album \"Highwayman\". In 1985, the song became the inspiration for the naming of the supergroup The Highwaymen, which featured Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson. Their first album, \"Highwayman\", became a number one platinum-selling album, and their version of the song went to number one on the Hot Country Songs \"Billboard\" chart in a twenty-week run. Their version earned Webb a Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1986. The song has since been recorded by other artists. Webb himself included a different version on his 1996 album \"Ten Easy Pieces\", a live version on his 2007 album \"Live and at Large\", and a duet version with Mark Knopfler on 2010 album \"Just Across the River\"."

The play's main themes include justice, \"mortality and mercy in Vienna,\" and the dichotomy between corruption and purity: \"some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall.\" Mercy and virtue prevail, as the play does not end tragically, with virtues such as compassion and forgiveness being exercised at the end of the production. While the play focuses on justice overall, the final scene illustrates that Shakespeare intended for moral justice to temper strict civil justice: a number of the characters receive understanding and leniency, instead of the harsh punishment to which they, according to the law, could have been sentenced."

      "\"Nasty Girl\" is a song by rapper The Notorious B.I.G. It was released in 2005 in the US and on January 16, 2006 in the UK. The single reached #1 in the United Kingdom (this being his first #1 in the country, just under a year after \"rival\" rapper 2Pac had also achieved his first #1 there also with \"Ghetto Gospel\"). The song features guest appearances from Jagged Edge, P. Diddy, Avery Storm, and Nelly and the video also contains guest appearances from Pharrell, Usher, Fat Joe, 8 Ball & MJG, Teairra Mari, Jazze Pha, DJ Green Lantern, Naomi Campbell and Memphis Bleek. It can be found on the album \"\", a remixed album of Biggie Smalls' work. The lyrical section rapped by Notorious B.I.G is actually lifted from another of his songs called \"Nasty Boy\", featured on his second album \"Life After Death\". Despite this, the production to the song \"Nasty Boy\" is completely different from that for \"Nasty Girl\", and apart from the lyrical sample, and the second verse (rapped by P. Diddy) rapped in the style of Biggie's second verse of Nasty Boy, the two songs bear no similarities. The chorus, sung by Jagged Edge, which has the line \"Grab your titties for B.I.G.\", references \"Player's Anthem\", which he says \"Bitches, rub your titties if you love Big Poppa\".",

      "The Art Deco style, which originated in France just before World War I, had an important impact on architecture and design in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s. The most famous examples were the skyscrapers of New York, including the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and Rockefeller Center in New York City. It combined modern aesthetics, fine craftsmanship and expensive materials, and became the symbol of luxury and modernity. While rarely used in residences, it was frequently used for office buildings, government buildings, train stations, movie theaters, diners and department stores. It also was frequently used in furniture, and in the design of automobiles, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as toasters and radio sets. In the late 1930s, during the Great Depression, it featured prominently in the architecture of the immense public works projects sponsored by the Works Progress Administration and the Public Works Administration, such as the Golden Gate Bridge and Hoover Dam. The style competed throughout the period with the modernist architecture, and came to an abrupt end in 1939 with the beginning of World War II. The style was rediscovered in the 1960s, and many of the original buildings have been restored and are now historical landmarks.",

      "The turnover-pulse hypothesis was constructed by paleoanthropologist Elisabeth Vrba, and is used to gauge the rate of survival and adaptation within species. The turnover-pulse hypothesis makes clear predictions regarding the responses of species to changing ecological factors. She defined turnover pulses as involving episodes of climatic change which caused geographic isolation in various taxa; the isolation subsequently spurred extinction and speciation in several different clades. The turnover pulse hypothesis is significant because it extends the geographic radiation concept from a single to a multi-clade context. The theory's key features are based on the sequence of species in the palaeontology of related genera, and environmental aspects in adaptation, survival and extinction. The majority of turnover pulses that occur result in small peaks affecting a small number of species, and typically involve a small geographic area. It is important to note that, based on Vrba and the turnover-pulse hypothesis, evolutionary change is caused by physical changes in the environment, such as climate change, tectonic plate shifting, and astronomical catastrophes, among other things."

Davuluri drew upon these experiences to promote her platform \"Celebrating Diversity Through Cultural Competency\" during her year as Miss America. Since ending her reign as Miss America in September 2014, Davuluri has continued to travel throughout the United States and India as a speaker and advocate for diversity, gender equality, and the promotion of STEM education."
