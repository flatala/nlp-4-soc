    "evidences": [
      "We contacted the surgeon general’s office, which directed us to statements from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. NIDA noted that marijuana may have a gateway effect, but that most people who use the drug don’t progress to other, harder substances; and that alcohol and nicotine appear to have a similar impact. The idea that marijuana can \"prime your brain for addiction\" has some basis: namely, the results of some studies conducted with rodents. For instance, Adams’ office noted that preclinical studies indicate exposure to THC – marijuana’s main psychoactive compound –  during a period roughly equivalent to adolescence in rats resulted in greater self-administration of heroin when the animals reach adulthood. In addition, THC exposure yielded changes in their brains’ reward system – in other words, yes, priming the brain for the rewarding effects of opioids. But, Isen said, it’s scientifically problematic to draw a line from the effects seen in rodents to what might be happening to a human. \"We should remain agnostic about the surgeon general’s claim,\" Isen argued. Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa., took a more optimistic view of that research, arguing that the animal evidence is \"very clear\" when it comes to marijuana’s neurological impact. \"What we know is strong enough to say that exposure during adolescence when the brain is developing is a risk,\" said Susan Weiss, a scientific adviser to the NIDA director. But how meaningful of a risk – and how it compares to other drugs – is exceptionally tough to say, given the limitations on research. Studies on actual humans are limited because people who use marijuana at a young age may be exposed to other risk factors, such as peer influences using harder drugs, or sociodemographic factors that might predispose them to abuse or addiction. As Dr. Sue Sisley, an Arizona-based psychiatrist who tracks the state of marijuana research, put it: \"I don’t see very much good, rigorous data to confirm either way.\" In the most narrow sense, marijuana indeed has a \"unique\" effect on the brain. It elicits a response from what are called \"endocannabinoid receptors.\" Other drugs don’t – they interact with different brain receptors. On a practical level, Isen said, while one could highlight the distinct scientific effect marijuana has, \"there is no evidence that marijuana has a uniquely deleterious effect on the developing brain - certainly not more than other substances such as alcohol.\""

      "Coverage for immigrants in the country illegally Another portion of California’s 2019-20 budget expands health coverage for young adults in the country illegally. Medi-Cal, funded by state and federal taxes, offers free or low-cost health care coverage for low-income children and adults in California. In 2019-20, this expansion is expected to cost California about $98 million, with an estimated $74 million coming from the state’s general fund. The additional funding, beyond the approximately $74 million from the state’s general fund, will come from the federal government and be used to pay for emergency and pregnancy-related services, he said. \"As with the prior expansion, the general fund cost of this new expansion will be paid for with tax revenues that are generated by California’s current tax system, with no tax increase,\" Graves said.",

Californians who don’t have health coverage in 2020 — and who don’t qualify for exemptions — would have to pay a penalty in 2021 when they file their 2020 state income tax return. The subsidies will go \"to legally residing Californians up and down the income stream, including those above 400% of the poverty level that otherwise would not qualify for assistance,\" Wright said.

      "Bloomberg’s net worth, as listed by Forbes magazine’s richest list, was $64.2 billion at the time of the Feb. 19 debate. That was enough to rank him as the 12th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes . The Sanders campaign’s source is a column by Matt Bruenig of the People’s Policy Project , a think tank that has \"a special focus on socialist and social democratic economic ideas.\" Bruenig was more specific than Sanders, writing that by his calculation of Federal Reserve \"summary extract public data ,\" Bloomberg owns nearly six times as much wealth as the bottom 38% of households. When we contacted Bruenig, he said he used the Federal Reserve’s Summary Extract Public Data , which is offered for researchers to make calculations using statistical software. Bruenig said he sorted all households from those with the least wealth to those with the most wealth. He then added the wealth of the bottom 38% of American households to get $11.4 billion. Then, he determined how many household units this accounted for and found the answer to be 47.8 million. You can then multiply the 47.8 million households by 2.63 (the average number of people per household ) to come up with 125.7 million people. Matthew Gross, a doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan with data-analyzing experience, helped PolitiFact replicate Bruenig’s math. Gross found that the bottom 38% had about $6 billion in wealth, rather than Bruenig’s $11.4 billion, but either way, this was enough to verify the calculation that Bloomberg had more wealth than the bottom 38% of American households combined. Meanwhile, he found that the 38th percentile alone owns about $50 billion. Together, then, percentiles 0 through 38 collectively own about $6 billion in wealth, which is less than Bloomberg had. In a technical sense, however, tens of millions of Americans join Bloomberg in owning more wealth than the bottom 37% of households combined, since the bottom 37% are collectively in the red."
