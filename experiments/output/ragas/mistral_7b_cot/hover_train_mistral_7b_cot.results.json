It is an 8\u00a0mm bolt action infantry rifle that entered service in the French Army in 1887. It is a repeating rifle that can hold eight rounds in its forestock tube magazine, one round in the transporter plus one round in the chamber. The Lebel rifle has the distinction of being the first military firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition. The new propellant powder, \"\"Poudre B\",\" was nitrocellulose-based and had been invented in 1884 by French chemist Paul Vieille.
