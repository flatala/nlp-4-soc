In the past, the term was indeed roughly equivalent to what many consider grade level, said Alan Borsuk , a senior fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University Law School and longtime education reporter and columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. But that changed in 2013 when Wisconsin dramatically raised the achievement level needed to reach the \"proficient\" threshold.

Conversely, those without subsidies, especially younger or healthier consumers, might pay as much as 60% less than they would for the lowest-cost plan through the ACA, the analysis concluded.",

There are a few terms we need to break down: The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour has been in effect since 2009. Fair market rent is the 40th median percentile of rents (including utilities, but not telephone) paid by tenants who have moved in a locality during the last two years. It is a term used by the federal government in some housing programs and the bottom rent for what the study calls a \"modest\" home. The national coalition defines \" affordability \" as consistent\u00a0with a federal standard that no more than 30% of a household\u2019s gross income should be spent on rent and utilities. So, what the study found is that there is no U.S. locality where minimum wage earners, working 40 hours a week, can find a modest two-bedroom home that will rent for 30% or less of their gross income.",

            "Pelosi\u2019s brother-in-law, Ronald Pelosi, was on the board of a firm that made a small investment in a solar company, and that solar company received a $737 million loan guarantee for a project. Pelosi\u2019s company never received $737 million from Obama\u2019s Energy Department. Daily Politics Feed, the YouTube channel responsible for the video, says all of its videos are created by transcribing the text of stories from \"alternative news sources.\" The Illicit Info article is labeled as opinion. \"It was a loan guarantee to a company with a very small investment from a firm Ronald Pelosi joined after the deal in which he had no financial stake or benefit,\" the spokesperson said, noting that Ronald Pelosi is Nancy Pelosi\u2019s brother-in-law, not brother, as the video says. Several fact-checkers and news outlets have set the record straight since the deal was announced in 2011, including FactCheck.org , Snopes , the San Francisco Chronicle and Fortune . Each of them found that Ronald Pelosi\u2019s connection to SolarReserve, the parent company of the firm that received the loan for a project in Nevada, was blown out of proportion. According to those reports, the unsubstantiated claims first popped up shortly after the Energy Department announced in September 2011 that it would be providing a $737 loan guarantee to Tonopah Solar Energy, a subsidiary of SolarReserve, for a major solar project. At the time of the announcement, Ronald Pelosi was an \"independent director\" on the board of PCG Asset Management, a subsidiary of a private equity firm called Pacific Corporate Group, which had invested in SolarReserve, according to FactCheck.org . The $737 million sent to Tonopah Solar Energy was a loan guarantee, not a blank check, and SolarReserve told FactCheck.org and Snopes that Pacific Corporate Group\u2019s investment was a 2% share. Pelosi also provided FactCheck.org with documentation showing that he took in just $25,000 annually from his role on the board. Plus, Ronald Pelosi wasn\u2019t on the board at the time that Pacific Corporate Group made its investment in SolarReserve, according to the San Francisco Chronicle . The Chronicle reported that Pelosi didn\u2019t stand to profit from the firm\u2019s stake in SolarReserve, either."

            "Newer data available Asked for evidence supporting his discussion of violent crime, Sanfelippo\u2019s office pointed us to a policy brief the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum published in December 2019. But the 2018 data, which was available at the time,\u00a0 shows a noteworthy reversal, with the violent crime rate dropping after several years of steady increases. To address this, the FBI data notes which agencies have changed reporting practices each year and warns the crime figures are now \"not comparable to previous years\u2019 data.\" In the 2008 to 2017 period Sanfelippo referenced, the FBI flagged data from 46 Wisconsin municipalities as no longer being comparable to past years. That included three of the 10 largest cities \u2014 which you\u2019ll remember Sanfelippo cited specifically as having a 24% increase in violent crime. Using FBI crime data from 2008 and 2018 and removing the places that changed reporting practices in that span leaves us with 206 municipalities \u2014 still a solid sample size. Based on that group, the statewide violent crime rate rose from 4.3 to 4.7 per 1,000 residents from 2008 to 2018. But Milwaukee accounted for all of that change. Remove Milwaukee and the crime rate across the other 205 municipalities went from 1.77 per 1,000 to 1.74 per 1,000 \u2014 virtually unchanged. The memo said \u2014 again, based in part on data the FBI warned against comparing \u2014 that violent crime rates increased in all but two of the state\u2019s 10 largest cities. Sanfelippo instead claimed the crime rate increased in \"all but two Wisconsin cities.\" That\u2019s not even close to true. Using the 206 municipalities referenced above \u2014 those that have data for both 2008 and 2018 and haven\u2019t changed reporting practices \u2014 we find the crime rate rose in 98 municipalities, fell in 88 and was unchanged in 20.

These posts reportedly took off after Baltimore Mayor Jack Young issued a warning about white vans that he claimed, without evidence, were \"trying to snatch up young girls for human trafficking.\" Young said he got word of such incidents from Facebook rather than from the Baltimore Police Department, which later told reporters it had no reports of actual incidents that involved sex traffickers driving white vans with external locks. But Robert Lowery, vice president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , told Yahoo News that \"of the 420,000 missing children last year, there were around 30 or 40 physical abductions that involved, for example, grabbing them in public.\" In a statement to PolitiFact, the Polaris Project , a nonprofit organization that works to combat human trafficking, said it hasn\u2019t identified white vans with external locks as a trend.

            "Bloomberg\u2019s net worth, as listed by Forbes magazine\u2019s richest list, was $64.2 billion at the time of the Feb. 19 debate. That was enough to rank him as the 12th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes . The Sanders campaign\u2019s source is a column by Matt Bruenig of the People\u2019s Policy Project , a think tank that has \"a special focus on socialist and social democratic economic ideas.\" Bruenig was more specific than Sanders, writing that by his calculation of Federal Reserve \"summary extract public data ,\" Bloomberg owns nearly six times as much wealth as the bottom 38% of households. When we contacted Bruenig, he said he used the Federal Reserve\u2019s Summary Extract Public Data , which is offered for researchers to make calculations using statistical software. Bruenig said he sorted all households from those with the least wealth to those with the most wealth. He then added the wealth of the bottom 38% of American households to get $11.4 billion. Then, he determined how many household units this accounted for and found the answer to be 47.8 million. You can then multiply the 47.8 million households by 2.63 (the average number of people per household ) to come up with 125.7 million people. Matthew Gross, a doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan with data-analyzing experience, helped PolitiFact replicate Bruenig\u2019s math. Gross found that the bottom 38% had about $6 billion in wealth, rather than Bruenig\u2019s $11.4 billion, but either way, this was enough to verify the calculation that Bloomberg had more wealth than the bottom 38% of American households combined. Meanwhile, he found that the 38th percentile alone owns about $50 billion. Together, then, percentiles 0 through 38 collectively own about $6 billion in wealth, which is less than Bloomberg had. In a technical sense, however, tens of millions of Americans join Bloomberg in owning more wealth than the bottom 37% of households combined, since the bottom 37% are collectively in the red."

In May, results showed that 41% of children who participated in VPK were not ready for kindergarten. In response, DeSantis directed education commissioner Richard Corcoran to create an improvement plan. In the same press release , Corcoran called for \"a real accountability measure for all our school readiness programs\" and said it was a rallying cry to improve early learning. For the record, Florida law already requires VPK students to take a test at the outset of the program and at the end. Since the session just started, we don\u2019t yet know how far proposal will go or whether DeSantis supports it. His office did not respond to our questions about that. An aide to a bill sponsor, Sen. Gayle Harrell, said that Harrell doesn\u2019t know if DeSantis supports her bill."

Cellphone use accounts for only a subset of distracted driving deaths, which are far fewer than deaths from suicide or other causes. Driver inexperience is the foremost cause of teen crashes, not cellphones.",

            "\"I realize that I have framed that poorly in stating several times that the cell phone use it\u2019s self is the cause when in fact it is a major contributor but not responsible for all accidents,\" Rodgers wrote in an email. In 2015, motor vehicle crashes were the leading cause of death among \"children\" 8-15, \"youth\" 15-20, and \"young adults\" 21-24, according to the most recent data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Cellphones are just one factor For Rodgers\u2019 claim to be true, an overwhelming majority of teenage motor vehicle deaths would have to have been caused by cellphone use, so much so that it would still outnumber deaths caused by suicide (which account for roughly 1,000 fewer teen deaths than car crashes per year). However, texting comes nowhere close to topping the CDC\u2019s list of the leading causes of teen crashes. Driver inexperience takes first place, followed by driving with teen passengers, nighttime driving, and not using seat belts. Distracted driving (the category that texting while driving falls into) came in fifth. Further calling Rodgers\u2019 claim into doubt, cellphone use isn\u2019t even the leading cause of distracted driving. The most recent data available shows that in 2017, 271 teenagers died because of distracted driving, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Of those fatalities, only 23% \u2014 or 63 teen deaths \u2014 were caused by cellphones. There were approximately 2,500 deaths by suicide among people aged 15-19, by comparison."

Changes to Wisconsin\u2019s voter rolls When asked for evidence for Klobuchar\u2019s claim, a staffer pointed to a 2018 report from the left-leaning Center for Media and Democracy that indicated nearly 700,000 voters had been removed from the rolls since 2016. To meet a requirement under state law, the commission in 2017 removed more than 351,000 voters who hadn\u2019t voted in four years and didn\u2019t respond to a mailed notice to continue their registrations. Then, in 2018, the commission canceled the registrations of more than 300,000 voters after the agency\u2019s Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, identified voters who had become inactive or needed to update their registration.

        "explanation": "The evidence shows that Sen. Thom Tillis voted to repeal the ACA, which provided protections for people with pre-existing conditions. While he later proposed the 'Protect Act,' experts agree that it falls short of the comprehensive coverage offered by the ACA, including protections against price gouging. Therefore, the claim that Tillis voted to 'take away' coverage for people with pre-existing conditions is substantiated by the evidence.",
        "evidences": [
            "He voted to repeal the ACA, and later proposed a different law that aims to address pre-existing conditions. But experts say the Tillis plan, along with other Republican proposals, fall short of offering the coverage in the ACA. Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, insurers could deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions or inflate their premiums so much that they dropped coverage, as PolitiFact and its partners have previously reported. The Cunningham ad specifically mentions a vote from July 26, 2015: the roll call for a vote to allow the repeal of the health care law. You can see from the bill\u2019s \"statement of purpose\" that it was meant to \"repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 entirely.\" The record shows Tillis voted to repeal it. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com What Tillis said When PolitiFact reached out to the Tillis campaign, spokesman Andrew Romeo didn\u2019t dispute Tillis\u2019 vote from 2015. Romeo was referencing a bill Tillis co-sponsored known as \" The Protect Act ,\" which claims to protect people with pre-existing conditions. But experts say that bill falls short. Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow studying health reform and private insurance for the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the bill doesn\u2019t prevent insurance companies from price gouging. PolitiFact reported in 2019 that most of the Republican health care plans fail to fully protect people with pre-existing conditions. A fact-check of White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney singled out the plan proposed by Tillis and other Republican senators. It found that the bill included an option for companies to deny certain coverage if they weren\u2019t able to \"adequately\" deliver services. That fact-check quote critics of Obamacare, such as health care consultant Bob Laszewski and former Republican Senate health care policy staffer Rodney Whitlock, saying the Republican proposals fall short of the coverage offered by the ACA."

But in 2015, Biden said he told Obama \"go.\" Everyone in the room \"hedged their bet\" except CIA Director Leon Panetta, who said \"go.\" \"Mr. President, my suggestion is, don't go,\" Biden recounted. (When a reporter asked White House spokesman Jay Carney in 2012 about Biden\u2019s comments stating he was against the raid, Carney said: \"I know that he is speaking accurately.\") Obama\u2019s statement during a debate in 2012 supported the idea that Biden was critical about the raid proposal. Obama said that \"even some in my own party, including my current vice president,\" critiqued the proposed raid. But the quote by Biden was more vague: \"I remember walking up to his office and saying, \u2018Look, follow your instincts, follow your instincts.\u2019\" In 2015, Biden said he did tell Obama privately to go after bin Laden. Obama-era officials said Biden expressed skepticism Biden\u2019s claim that he told Obama to \"go\" conflicted with other accounts from Obama-era officials in their books. Obama\u2019s Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote in \" Hard Choices\" that Biden \"remained skeptical.\" Panetta wrote in \" Worthy Fights \" that Biden \"argued that we still did not have enough confidence that bin Laden was in the compound, and he came out firmly in favor of waiting for more information.\" Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote in \" Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War \" that he and Biden were the \"two primary skeptics.\""

Since our fact-check of Kirk, Snopes and other news outlets have also concluded that Pelosi did not violate the law. So has Jonathan Turley , the George Washington University law professor who testified against impeaching Trump in the House Judiciary Committee. Even Fox News host Laura Ingraham, whose on-air commentary is typically pro-Trump, knocked the idea in an interview with Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who filed an ethics complaint against Pelosi. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The federal statute in question sets a penalty for anyone who \"conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys\" any government record \"filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States.\" The statute also says that any person with \"custody\" of a government record cannot \"willfully and unlawfully\" conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, falsify or destroy it. Experts told us Pelosi\u2019s move was not illegal because her copy of Trump\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t the official government record that would need to be preserved. The State of the Union text was never \"filed or deposited\" with her, nor did she have \"custody\" of it in the legal sense. Trump handed her and Vice President Mike Pence copies before he began speaking. (AP) \"Her copy of the State of the Union address is not a government record or government property at all,\" Douglas Cox, professor of law at the City University of New York School of Law and an expert in the laws on the preservation of government records, told us. \"It is personal property.\" Under House rules , members of Congress are encouraged to preserve their records or donate them to a research institution for historical study, Cox said.

            "Falling back on old votes When asked to provide evidence for Gallagher\u2019s claim, his press secretary Jordan Dunn pointed to the same three House roll call votes that Gallagher\u2019s colleague from southeastern Wisconsin, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, used to make a claim about impeachment about a week earlier. Like Sensenbrenner, Gallagher\u2019s office claimed that lawmakers who voted \"no\" on the motion to table the impeachment measure were actually casting a \"yes\" vote on impeachment. \"In voting to oppose tabling a measure, that is literally an expression of support for continuing consideration of a measure,\" said Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, in an email. Though one can surely argue at least some Democrats were convinced Trump had committed impeachable offenses before the Ukraine call, no one cast an \"impeachment vote\" until Dec. 18. That\u2019s when Trump was impeached over allegations he withheld aid to Ukraine and asked the country to open an investigation into the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. So Gallagher is off point on the first part of the claim. At a Sept. 23, 2017 campaign rally in Huntsville, Ala., the president said :\u00a0 \"Wouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he\u2019s fired? He\u2019s fired!\u2019\" But Green\u2019s resolution admonished Trump for \"inciting hate and hostility, and sowing discord among the people of the United States on the basis of race and gender,\" not for chastising the football league itself. Indeed, in May 2018, when the NFL released a policy warning that players who protested during the national anthem would face consequences, Trump commended the league. Moreover, that paragraph was just one of 11 instances Green cited as examples of why the president should be impeached."

After he left the board, the company dissolved and re-formed in Singapore under a different name. Viscoil was a California-based holding company that dissolved in 2010. After it shuttered, Viscoil was folded into NRGLab, a Singapore-based company \"specializing in different areas of scientific research.\" Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact last year that Paul Pelosi Jr. worked for Viscoil for a short time. He denied that it had any dealings in Ukraine when he was working for the company. \"The company was based in Southern California and focused solely on U.S. business,\" he told PolitiFact in an email. \"The company later reorganized under a different name, but Paul Pelosi Jr. played no role in the new entity.\" The timeline Hammill offered fits the evidence we\u2019ve seen.

            "In a statement, his campaign told us that before Jill Biden went to the Corning Public Library , a campaign staff member arrived and saw that the American flag in the conference room reserved for the meet-and-greet \"was not properly dressed.\" In this case, according to the campaign, it wasn\u2019t draped correctly . \"Out of respect for the flag \u2014\u00a0because it could not be dressed properly in time for the event \u2014\u00a0the staff member asked the library if they were comfortable moving it to another room. The library staff member then moved the flag out of the room. In no way did this have anything to do with the pledge of allegiance and in no way did a directive come from Dr. (Jill) Biden. Leonard told us that she had heard several different accounts of what happened at the library, though she was not there to witness it herself. Leonard said one of the librarians told her that Jill Biden\u2019s staff arrived at the library before the event and wanted to remove the flag from the conference room, where it was hanging on a stand in the corner. \"One was the advance staff asked to remove it and one story was they weren\u2019t asked and just went ahead and set up the room the way they wanted to set up the room.\" The flag was relocated to the hallway, she said. One person told Leonard that \"they didn\u2019t want to say the pledge of allegiance,\" she said, and another told her that there was a smudge on the flag. Snopes, which also looked into this claim , spoke with Fred Shearer, president of the library board in Corning. Shearer said the campaign rented the room and arranged it themselves, moving the flag \"probably 5 feet into a hallway next to the room,\" according to Snopes."

        "explanation": "The claim that California residents cannot shower, do laundry, and flush on the same day due to water restrictions is false.

We fact-checked them when they first circulated in 2018. So did Snopes and a number of local news outlets . KTLA replaced the clip on its website with a correction noting that the segment \"included factual errors about two laws going into effect in 2020 regarding water conservation.\" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The misinformation spread so far and so fast that the California Department of Water Resources and the Association of California Water Agencies both issued statements debunking it. Individuals don\u2019t have to worry about fines The false claims about California water use center on two bills \u2014 Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668 \u2014 that Brown, the state\u2019s former governor, signed into law on May 31, 2018, as California was reeling from a five-year drought that ended in 2017. Broadly speaking, the laws instruct cities, water districts and some larger agricultural water districts to establish strict water budgets. But the new water limits \u2014 which kick in starting in 2023, not 2020 \u2014 won\u2019t target individuals. \"These are not individual mandates for homeowners, but actually a task given to each water district to average water consumption use out to hit the goal,\" Kostyrko said. \"There is nothing regulating the time a person may shower or when they may or may not do laundry,\" added Jim Metropulos, legislative director for state Assemblywoman Laura Friedman, who wrote Assembly Bill 1668. In sum, fines based on consumption will be administered to the water agencies that fail to meet their goals, not to individuals who use too much water in their daily lives. Senate Bill 606 does give water agencies the ability to fine some individual lawbreakers, the Sacramento Bee noted. But that\u2019s only when they violate local water-use limits during an official \"water shortage emergency\" that threatens \"human consumption, sanitation, and fire protection.\""

        "evidences": [
            "Like President George W. Bush before him, Obama did not capture or kill Soleimani after a designation was placed him. And a series of designations, escalated under Obama, made it more difficult for Soleimani to travel and conduct financial transactions. Obama didn\u2019t take action against Soleimani beyond that. The U.S. Treasury Department designated him in May 2011 for his role as the commander of the Quds Force, \"the primary conduit for Iran's support to the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate.\" The more serious move came in October 2011, when Treasury designated Soleimani again, saying he oversaw the Quds Force officers who plotted an attempt to assassinate Adel Al-Jubeir, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. \"I am unaware of any capture or kill mission that was publicly revealed against Soleimani by the Obama administration,\" Behnam Ben Taleblu , senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told us. Similarly, after Soleimani\u2019s death, Derek Chollet, assistant secretary of defense from 2012 to 2015, told the Daily Beast: \"To my knowledge, there was never a decision of \u2018We\u2019ve gotta go find this guy and get him.\u2019\" That comment was echoed by retired Gen. David Petraeus, the CIA director under Obama, on CBS\u2019 \"Face the Nation.\" But it goes too far to say that Obama didn\u2019t do anything, given that the designations themselves carried some force \u2014 for example, restricting Soleimani\u2019s ability to travel and finance his operations. \"The sanctions reflect the fact that the Obama administration took a number of steps \u2014 some seen many others unseen \u2014 to constrain Soleimani\u2019s activities,\" said Ned Price , who served as special assistant to Obama for national security affairs and was referred to us by an Obama spokesman. From 2011 on, Price argued, American service members and diplomats in Iraq were not attacked by Iranian proxies and militias as they have been since May 2018, when Trump implemented his maximum pressure strategy on Iran."

Fulks\u2019 phrasing on WTTW was less than clear. That said, the overall context of his remarks in that portion of the interview do suggest he was referring to those who actually pay the top rate he cited. His spokesperson cited a finding from a 2018 report by researchers at the Stanford Center on Poverty & Inequality that shows net migration of millionaires overall since 2007 has remained positive. However, the study also found \u2014\u00a0based on an analysis that compared migration changes with a control group of high earners not subject to the top rate \u2014 that the 2012 increase did indeed lead to a small loss of 0.04% of California\u2019s millionaire population. \"Our overall conclusion is, yes, millionaires do sometimes move to lower-tax states \u2014 as we see for California in 2012,\" researcher Cristobal Young told us in an email. \"In 2012, there was a large tax increase that produced millionaire out-migration \u2014 but by an amount that was too small to matter for overall state revenues or tax policy,\" he said. Using the same set of tax data, researchers at Stanford\u2019s conservative Hoover Institution found a larger increase in the rate of departures among top earners after 2012. Their report defined a departing taxpayer more broadly than Young and his colleague did and did not address net migration. Meanwhile, reports by California\u2019s nonpartisan legislative research arm and the Sacramento Bee have found that since the early 2000s, the state has gained rather than lost residents making over $100,000."

Additionally, the evidence indicates that Pence could have cast the deciding vote in a hypothetical tied Kavanaugh confirmation, rendering the claim about blocking Kavanaugh misleading.",
        "evidences": [
            "We found that Bloomberg did spend millions to help Toomey; whether that changed the outcome of the election is anybody\u2019s guess. But the post exaggerates when it says the race had the power to change the Supreme Court. Toomey backed legislation to expand checks to online sales and gun shows \u2014 a position shared by Bloomberg, who helped launch the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety . A New York Times analysis of Bloomberg\u2019s donations stated that he spent $11.7 million to support Toomey in 2016. We used the database of donations posted by the Center for Responsive Politics and found that Bloomberg\u2019s Independence USA PAC spent $5.9 million in support of Toomey in 2016. At the beginning of 115th Congress in January 2017, there were 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and 2 independents who caucused with the Democrats. When Alabama Democrat Doug Jones took office in January 2018, that gave Republicans a 51-49 lead . If McGinty had won, the Senate would have ended up at 50-50. Washington University political scientist Steve Smith said that there are Senate precedents that allow the vice president\u2019s party \u2014 in this case Mike Pence \u2014 to be treated as the majority party. However the majority leader was the Republican leader. If the Senate found itself in another 50-50 split, that would lead to another round of negotiations. \"The Democrats would not control the Senate in the case of a 50-50 division,\" he said. If the vice president was Republican, the majority leader would be Republican.\" Senate vote on Kavanaugh Now that brings us to the part of the Facebook post that said after Jones won, if McGinty had also won, the Democrats \"could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court.\" This statement does have a qualifier of \"could,\" but if it assumes that a McGinty win alone could have changed the outcome. The Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh in October 2018. If we take the hypothetical scenario of McGinty beating Toomey, and assume she would have followed Democratic Party lines, and all other senators would have voted in the same way as they actually did, the vote would have tied 49-49. That means that Pence could have cast a deciding vote . Other scenarios are equally hypothetical."

It also clarifies that abortion laws vary by state and do not generally allow abortion 'up until the moment of birth.' The referenced care for nonviable pregnancies or severe fetal abnormalities is distinct from abortion and does not involve killing a live infant.",
        "evidences": [
            "To be clear: killing an infant after birth is illegal, and people on both sides of the abortion debate agree that this act should be illegal. Under federal law, the definitions of a person, human being, child and individual all include infants \"born alive at any stage of development.\" In Virginia, a woman can choose to obtain an abortion through the end of the second trimester of pregnancy, up to 28 weeks from her last menstrual period. The bill Virginia lawmakers considered in 2019 proposed multiple changes to state laws addressing abortion, including the provision regulating the procedure in the third trimester. The proposal would have lowered the number of physicians required to authorize a third-trimester abortion from three to one and remove the \"substantial and irremediable\" threshold in the law. But days later, Tran said she misspoke : \"I should have said: \u2018Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.\u2019\" A spokeswoman for Cruz pointed to the language of Tran\u2019s bill and said it clearly allows abortion up until the moment of birth, but Tran\u2019s bill only changed the requirements in place before a doctor can perform a third-trimester abortion. Virginia law prohibits \"partial birth infanticide,\" the killing of an infant who has \"been born alive, but who has not been completely extracted or expelled from its mother.\" Northam rejected this characterization of his remarks and a spokesperson said the comments were about options for care available to women with a nonviable pregnancy or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality. In these cases, where there is \"little or no prospect\" of an infant surviving after birth, families might opt for perinatal palliative care , or comfort care \u2014 prioritizing comfort while allowing an infant to die naturally without exercising full resuscitation efforts. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes this care as existing on a spectrum of care, \"which includes pregnancy termination (abortion) and full neonatal resuscitation and treatment.\" This type of care is rare \u2014 a study of deaths at children\u2019s hospitals found that while neonates represented 41% of all deaths, perinatal palliative care was only utilized in 2% of cases \u2014 and does not meet the definition of abortion."

That method results in about 39% of the members being millionaires. According to the Survey of Consumer Finances from the Federal Reserve Board, 12% of family economic units had $1 million or more of net wealth (all assets minus all debts), said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. We found some other analyses about how many Americans are millionaires, but none were the 1% cited in the Facebook post. Credit Suisse\u2019s Global Wealth Report showed that there are approximately 18.6 million Americans with a net worth in excess of $1 million, which works out to about 8% of the adult population. Spectrem Group found that in 2018, there were 11.8 million American households with a net worth of at least $1 million. That works out to about 5% of the adult population. But if we used income as the benchmark, the calculation for Congress would be different. The House and Senate members don\u2019t earn $1 million in their salary, but some earn investment income. For the population as a whole, IRS data for 2017 showed about 500,000 tax returns had incomes of at least $1 million. There were about 104 million tax returns filed, so that means less than 1 percent were for people who earned at least $1 million."

The Washington Post reported on the Enquirer article at the time. According to the Post, Pruitt confirmed his account about the marijuana smoking, said he had given the marijuana to Meyer, and he said the Enquirer had paid him for the story. But none of that goes to the idea that Kennedy regularly used marijuana at the White House in order to fight his ailments. Stacey Flores Chandler, a reference archivist at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, told us the foundation has Kennedy\u2019s medical records from the 1950s and \u201860s as well as records of several of Kennedy's physicians. \"I haven't found any evidence in either the records here or in secondary sources that the president used cannabis as a treatment for any of his medical conditions,\" she told us.

            "Christopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University, helped make sense of some of the figures. He calculated the average, 10-year mortality rate for flu using CDC data and found it was 0.1%. That 0.1% rate is frequently cited among experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. According to statistics released Feb. 17 by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the mortality rate for coronavirus was 2.3%. That\u2019s based on cases reported through Feb. 11 and calculated by dividing the numbers of coronavirus-related deaths at the time (1,023) by the number of the confirmed cases (44,672) of the coronavirus. But this report has limitations, Mores said, including the vague way Chinese officials are defining who has been infected by the coronavirus. \"We have not been able to understand what precisely has gone on there,\" said Mores. The WHO said in a press conference Monday that in Wuhan, China, the city where the virus first hit, the mortality rate ranged from 2% to 4%. Officials said that in the rest of China, outside of Wuhan, the mortality rate of coronavirus is 0.7%. Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the mortality rate in China has since risen to 0.9%. Right now he doesn\u2019t see a similarity in the flu mortality rate and the coronavirus mortality rate. Multiple experts told us that the number of coronavirus cases not just in China but worldwide has probably been undercounted because many people with the infection do not suffer serious symptoms and may not seek medical treatment. It is possible that only those who have tested positive are being counted as \"confirmed cases.\" Until the case definition is expanded, they said, to include people clinicians think may have COVID-19 but who were not tested for it, then the total estimated number of cases will remain lower than the likely reality. But, if the number of cases widens to include those with mild symptoms who have not been tested, then the mortality rate will go down. This is the way mortality rates are calculated for the flu, said Mores. The numbers of flu illnesses and deaths are estimates based not only on positive flu tests, but also on doctors\u2019 suspicions and symptomatic diagnosis."

Hampton Sides, author of \"Hellhound on His Trail: The Stalking of Martin Luther King Jr. and the International Hunt for His \u00adAssassin,\" told Time magazine in April 2018 that the source of many conspiracies about King\u2019s death can be traced to Ray\u2019s guilty plea, which stopped his trial from proceeding. \"There was a huge amount of evidence presented in Memphis that didn\u2019t see the light of day in a public forum,\" Sides said. \"I think that contributed to the sense of conspiracy, like a \u2018What are they hiding?\u2019 kind of thing.\" As for the actual photo in the Instagram post, it doesn\u2019t show King at St. Joseph Hospital in Memphis.

The jury issued a verdict that said Jowers and \"others, including government agencies\" were part of a conspiracy to assassinate King. The jury awarded the Kings the $100 in damages that they sought. But in a 2000 review of the lawsuit, the Justice Department found no evidence to back up the verdict. \"Most of the witnesses and writings offered to support the various government-directed conspiracy claims relied exclusively on secondhand and thirdhand hearsay and speculation,\" the Justice Department wrote in its report on King vs. Jowers."

And on Feb. 18, 2020, a group of 27 senators sent a letter to current National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien to ask him to appoint a new global health security expert to the NSC. \"The fact that they explicitly dismantled the office in the White House that was tasked with preparing for exactly this kind of a risk is hugely concerning,\" Jeremy Konyndyk, who ran foreign disaster assistance in the Obama administration, told the Guardian . \"Both the structure and all the institutional memory is gone now.\" Instead, Trump has looked within his administration to fill roles for the coronavirus response. Last month, Trump appointed his Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar, to chair a coronavirus task force. It\u2019s not accurate to say that Trump has been \"defunding\" the CDC, but he has tried to make cuts in key programs. The Trump administration\u2019s initial proposals for the budgets for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases at CDC \u2014 a key player in the fight against coronavirus \u2014 have consistently been lower than what was spent the previous year. The administration proposed $61.7 million less in 2018 than 2017; $96.4 million less in 2019 than in 2018; $114.4 million less in 2020 than in 2019; and $85.3 million less in 2021 than 2020. However, Congress reshapes presidential recommendations as they see fit when they craft final spending bills. Every year since Trump has been president, lawmakers have passed bills \u2014 bills signed by Trump \u2014 that not only exceeded what Trump requested on emerging infections but also exceeded what had been spent the previous year. As the chart below shows, funding increased every year from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2020."

        "explanation": "The evidence points to differences in the rules for the Trump impeachment compared to those for Nixon and Clinton, including a lack of symmetrical subpoena objection rights and limited participation rights for Trump's lawyers in the investigating committees. These differences indicate fewer due process protections and fewer protections for minority rights in the Trump impeachment process.",
        "evidences": [
            "During the Nixon and Clinton impeachment hearings, the majority and minority parties could seek subpoenas, and both of them could lodge an objection to the other\u2019s request. The text of the rules for both the Nixon and Clinton hearings was the same (bold emphasis is ours): The power to issue a subpoena \"may be exercised by the chairman and the ranking minority member acting jointly, or, if either declines to act, by the other acting alone, except that in the event either so declines, either shall have the right to refer to the committee for decision the question whether such authority shall be so exercised.\" Of course, if it came to a committee vote, by definition, the majority has the votes to win. In contrast, the rule approved for the Trump impeachment effectively says the Democrats can object to a Republican request, but the Republicans can\u2019t object to a Democratic one. The business of \"either shall have the right\" is missing in the current rules. \"Under the Clinton and Nixon rules, it was symmetrical,\" said Stanford law professor Dave Alan Sklansky. \"Now there\u2019s an asymmetry.\" But again, both then and now, if it comes to a committee vote, the majority will get what it wants. And for the witnesses Republicans want, they face the same potential hurdle they faced back in 1974 and 1998. 2: Access to records Cole misrepresents the issue of member access to materials in the Trump impeachment inquiry, and he\u2019s wrong about what took place in the Nixon investigation. He said the resolution doesn\u2019t \"guarantee\" that all members have access to hearing materials. But his staff could point to no document or statement from the Democrats that denied access. His office told us \"the concern is that current chairmen are not respecting\" standing House rules. The Democratic materials say nothing about this one way or the other. Compared with the Nixon process , lawmakers imposed strict limits on who could see what. Clinton\u2019s lawyers did participate in the Judiciary Committee process, and the House resolution gives Trump\u2019s lawyers the same rights for that committee. However, Cole has a point that Trump\u2019s lawyers can\u2019t participate in the House committees currently investigating the president, most importantly, the Select Intelligence Committee. In the Trump investigation, Republicans on the Intelligence Committee can call witnesses and ask questions. They don\u2019t have the same powers as the majority, but they have the right to participate and represent Trump\u2019s interests. Once it gets to the Judiciary Committee, the House resolution grants Trump and his lawyers more rights than Clinton or Nixon enjoyed."

The mortality rate for infants born to non-Hispanic white mothers was 4.67 deaths per 1,000 live births, meaning infants born to black mothers have an infant mortality rate 2.35 times higher than infants born to white mothers, according to the CDC. Bloomberg\u2019s claim wasn\u2019t limited to Texas, but this trend is also visible at the state level. A 2018 report from the CDC looked at infant mortality data from 2013 to 2015 by state and race and found that, in Texas, the mortality rate for infants born to non-Hispanic white women was 5 deaths per 1,000 live births and was 10.52 for infants born to black women. The five leading causes of all infant deaths in 2017 identified by the CDC were all health related: Congenital malformations: 21% of infant deaths Disorders related to short gestation and low birthweight: 17% of infant deaths Maternal complications: 6% of infant deaths Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): 6% of infant deaths Unintentional injuries: 6% of infant deaths In a 2019 report, the CDC noted that infants born to black women had the highest mortality rates for disorders related to short gestation (premature birth) and low birthweight and maternal complications. Numerous academic studies and media investigations have highlighted correlations between access to health care and the disparity in infant and maternal mortality rates between black and white mothers. But access to health care is widely considered to be one of many contributing factors. One 2017 study published in the American Journal of Public Health identified other factors that contribute to the high black infant mortality rate: socioeconomic status, maternal behavior, \"exposure to protective and risk factors over the course of a woman\u2019s life,\" and certain historical factors like segregation, limited educational opportunities, structural racism, and intergenerational poverty. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2019 explored how state Medicaid expansion associated with changes in low birthweight and preterm birth across different races \u2014 which are more likely to affect black mothers and infants than white mothers and infants."

        "explanation": "While some evidence highlights challenges in accessing care and mediocre self-reported health statuses among Medicaid recipients, other studies strongly demonstrate that Medicaid improves access to care, utilization of services, and health outcomes, particularly compared to being uninsured. The claim oversimplifies the situation and omits significant positive findings, leading to a conclusion that is not fully supported by the evidence.",
        "evidences": [
            "A CMS spokesperson responded by pointing us to a CMS fact sheet comparing the health status of people on Medicaid to people with private insurance and Medicare. The fact sheet, among other things, showed 43% of Medicaid enrollees report their health as excellent or very good compared with 71% of people with private insurance, 14% on Medicare and 58% who were uninsured. The spokesperson also pointed to a 2017 report by the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC), a congressional advisory board, that noted: \"Medicaid enrollees have more difficulty than low-income privately insured individuals in finding a doctor who accepts their insurance and making an appointment; Medicaid enrollees also have more difficulty finding a specialist physician who will treat them.\" Several national Medicaid experts said Verma is wrong to use health status as a proxy for whether Medicaid helps improve health for people. That\u2019s because to be eligible for Medicaid, people must fall into a low-income bracket, which can impact their health in many ways. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard University, said Verma\u2019s comparison of the health status of Medicaid recipients against people with Medicare or private insurance is invalid because the populations are so different and face varied health risks. For a better mechanism to gauge health outcomes under Medicaid, experts point to dozens of studies that track what happened in states that chose in the past six years to pursue the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion. \"Most research demonstrates that Medicaid expansion has improved access to care, utilization of services, the affordability of care, and financial security among the low-income population,\" concluded the Kaiser Family Foundation in summarizing findings from more than 300 studies. \"Studies show improved self-reported health following expansion and an association between expansion and certain positive health outcomes.\" Studies found the expansion of Medicaid led to lower mortality rates for people with heart disease and among end-stage renal disease patients initiating dialysis . Researchers also reported that Medicaid expansion was associated with declines in the length of stay of hospitalized patients. A 2017 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found 84% of Medicaid recipients felt they were able to get all the medical care they needed in the previous six months. Only 3% said they could not get care because of long wait times or because doctors would not accept their insurance. Verma cites a 2017 MACPAC report that noted some people on Medicaid have issues accessing care. But that report also noted: \"The body of work to date by MACPAC and others shows that Medicaid beneficiaries have much better access to care, and much higher health care utilization, than individuals without insurance, particularly when controlling for socioeconomic characteristics and health status.\" It also notes that \"Medicaid beneficiaries also fare as well as or better than individuals with private insurance on some access measures.\" The report said people with Medicaid are as likely as those with private insurance to have a usual source of care, a doctor visit each year and certain services such as a Pap test to detect cervical cancer. On the negative side, the report said Medicaid recipients are more likely than privately insured patients to experience longer waiting times to see a doctor. They also are less likely to receive mammograms, colorectal tests and dental visits than the privately insured. \"Compared to having no insurance at all, having Medicaid improves access to care and improves health,\" said Rachel Garfield, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"There is pretty strong evidence that Medicaid helps patients get the care they need.\""

The section in question, 16.9, says: \"By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration.\" The idea , though, was to help refugees prove their identities when seeking asylum, and biometrics refers to many different types of identification (not just microchips). When operational, the tool will provide refugees with the ability to present their IDs via an app on their smartphones at border crossings to prove they`re coming from a refugee camp and qualify for aid. Since then, biometric technology has been developed to help identify refugee populations (though there have been some concerns about the practice).

Clinton, 1992 Before his election in 1992, Clinton had not held elected federal office, either. That said, including Clinton among those who were \"new on the national scene\" is somewhat debatable, Rauch said. By 1992, Clinton had been governor of Arkansas for more than a decade and had chaired the National Governors Association and the Democratic Leadership Council . Clinton \"was well known in Democratic party leadership circles, so under some definitions of 'the national scene,\u2019 he might not count as an entirely new face,\" Dominguez said. Obama, 2008 Experts agreed that although Obama was a U.S. senator by the time of his 2008 election, it is reasonable to consider him a candidate who was new on the national scene. Obama had not completed his first term in the Senate and was not well known nationally beyond his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention ."

        "explanation": "The evidence confirms that individuals with significant assets, including millionaires, were eligible for food stamps due to loopholes in state rules. The Trump administration took action to address these loopholes by proposing new rules to fix eligibility criteria, focusing on income and asset limits.",
        "evidences": [
            "In July 2019, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a news release about proposed new rules for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps. The release said the proposed rule \"would fix a loophole that has expanded SNAP recipients in some states to include people who receive assistance when they clearly don\u2019t need it.\" Reviews of their income and assets would need to be conducted to ensure that, in most cases, their income is at or below 130% of the federal poverty level and they do not have liquid assets worth more than $2,250. For a family of three, 130% of the federal poverty level is about $2,250 a month. Nationwide, the proposal is expected to save $2.5 billion and cut benefits to about 3 million people. The evidence When asked to provide backup, Grothman\u2019s staff pointed us to several news articles, including a Sept. 16, 2019 report from the Washington Examiner that reminded readers about the case of Leroy Fick who continued to receive food stamps after winning $2 million in the Michigan State Lottery in 2010. \"Fick used his winnings to buy a new home and an Audi convertible, all while continuing to receive SNAP benefits,\" the Examiner article said. At the time, Michigan used federal guidelines that based eligibility for food stamps solely on income. The state considered Fick\u2019s $850,000 lump sum lottery payment an asset -- not income. So, under state policy then in effect, Fick could legally get food stamps. The state subsequently banned anyone with assets of more than $5,000, excluding a car, from the food stamp program. That ban knocked Fick off the food stamp rolls. Cloud (Minn.) Times, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, Undersander said he and his wife have a net worth that \"exceeds $1 million.\" In that and other accounts, he said he wanted to expose a loophole that would allow people who are wealthy, or at least those not needy, to qualify for food stamps. Undersander said he gave the money he received to charity When his case was described at a June 20, 2019 House agriculture subcommittee , the story ignited a partisan firestorm."

            "Hillary Clinton \"paid for a Russian dossier to win an election\" This contains an element of truth, but it isn\u2019t the full picture. The dossier that the Facebook post is referencing was written by former British spy Christopher Steele about President Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. Many of the details included in the dossier were salacious but unverified. It was not written by Russian officials, as the Facebook post seems to claim. We found that Fusion GPS was hired to work on behalf of the Clinton campaign, but the firm was already investigating Trump at the time. Then, Fusion GPS hired Steele to produce memos on Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. Bill Clinton \"made $500k for a Russian speech\" This is accurate. And in the course of our investigation of Clinton\u2019s federal financial disclosure forms , we found that former President Clinton gave a talk in 2010 to a Russian finance corporation. He was compensated $500,000. Hillary Clinton \"sold 20% of US Uranium to Russia\" This is misleading. Its actual production, though, is a smaller portion of the uranium produced in the United States, at 11% in 2014, according to Oilprice.com. They did, and in 2013, Russia assumed 100% ownership of Uranium One and renamed it Uranium One Holding. In our previous fact-check , we noted that Clinton sat on the committee that approved the sale \u2014\u00a0but the decision was not hers alone. She also did not have the power to veto the committee\u2019s decision. The Clinton Foundation \"received $150M from Russia\" This is exaggerated. Nine people related to Uranium One donated to the Clinton Foundation. But the bulk of the money, about $131 million, came from Giustra \u2014 a businessman from Canada, not Russia."

She said she has spent the last five years working as a summer hire at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine but never worked with the Ukraininan Embassy in the United States or elsewhere. \"I have no ties to the Ukrainian government or military outside of the work that I did while employed with the State Department.\" Ivanna Voronovych\u2019s mother, Viktoria Voronovych, is a Ukrainian-born American citizen and co-founder of the nonprofit International Alliance for Fraternal Assistance, which has helped raise money to deliver medical supplies, gear, equipment and other items to Ukrainian soldiers who were fighting against Russia-backed rebels, according to an interview she gave in 2015 to the Macomb Daily, a newspaper in Detroit. The photo in the upper-left corner of the viral Facebook post shows Viktoria Voronovych receiving a medal from the patriarch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church for her conflict zone volunteer work, according to Ivanna Voronovych, who also sent PolitiFact an image of the medal, which indicates it was presented in 2015. Ivanna Voronovych said that the organization, which appears to be based in Kiev , raised money from other Ukrainians now living in the United States, most notably Michigan, Illinois and North Carolina. These days, Ivanna Voronovych said, her mother\u2019s work involves supporting people with disabilities sustained either at birth or by way of involvement in the conflict. \"This story is a hoax and an outlandish compilation of twisted lies,\" Voronovych said."

During the 2017-2018 school year, the latest year for which the group has updated figures, Chicago ranked 22nd out of 124 for its starting salary. Chicago\u2019s ranking improved for teachers with more years of teaching and higher education credentials, according to the center\u2019s analysis. For example, a teacher with a master\u2019s degree and 10 years of job experience made more under Chicago\u2019s salary schedule than their counterparts in all but two of the districts included in the group\u2019s database. Even so, Lightfoot didn\u2019t constrain her remarks to the nation\u2019s 100-plus largest districts either. And salary schedules are different than the average compensation a teacher in a given district actually receives. \"A salary schedule really doesn\u2019t tell you what the reality is on the ground,\" said Robert Bruno, a labor expert at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, adding that it doesn\u2019t say how many teachers are actually making that pay.

Chicago Public Schools came out 109th of the state\u2019s more than 800 school districts based on average teacher pay alone.

CBO's preliminary estimate found this bill \u2018would result in lower spending on research and development and thus reduce the introduction of new drugs.\u2019",
        "explanation": "While the evidence acknowledges that there may be a reduction in drug approvals due to Pelosi's drug pricing plan, the magnitude of the reduction and its impact on innovation are contested. The claim of $1 trillion loss and widespread harm to innovation lacks strong support, and experts highlight that the impact on new drug discovery would likely be minimal. Additionally, alternative benefits such as increased affordability are not factored into the claim's reasoning.",
        "evidences": [
            "\"They\u2019re trying to provide some sense of the relative impact on drug development, but I don\u2019t think we have enough data to provide this,\" said Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University. \"It\u2019s not a fact. It\u2019s a preliminary estimate that is on very shaky ground.\" The CBO estimates that, over the next decade, between eight and 15 fewer drugs would come to market. But the big picture matters: Every year, the Food and Drug Administration approves 30 new drugs, on average. That\u2019s 300 new drugs over 10 years. So if you assume 15 fewer drugs out of 300 projected approvals, that\u2019s a loss of 5%. Certainly that is, as PhRMA argued, a reduction. But none of the experts we spoke with saw it as a blow to innovation. \"The lower prices envisioned by [Pelosi\u2019s] bill would barely slow new drug discovery at all,\" argued Dr. Peter Bach, who directs the Drug Pricing Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in an op-ed for Bloomberg . In fact, she said, \"there is a good reason to believe that the drugs you would lose are those that have the smallest benefit and highest price tag.\" This gets at another point: A substantial portion of drug research and development isn\u2019t actually done by drugmakers. The riskiest portions often are conducted in government-funded labs, noted Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor at Harvard Medical School who studies pharmaceutical policy. Drug companies get involved much later, making it even less certain that a loss in pharmaceutical revenue would meaningfully discourage breakthrough drug innovation. Other arguments PhRMA also pointed us to a Dec. 3 report put out by the White House Council of Economic Advisers . It found a much higher impact \u2015 arguing that H.R.3 would result in \"as many as 100 fewer drugs\" entering the American market in the next 10 years. The CEA number rests on a series of assumptions. But experts called this analysis suspect at best. Dusetzina also noted that the analysis doesn\u2019t consider the increased revenue drug companies might experience from more people being able to afford drugs and therefore buy them."

            "Impeachment process unique to Trump Steil is objecting to Trump not having the same protections before the Intelligence Committee that past presidents had before impeachment committees, but experts say this is the first time a House committee has filled such an investigative role. \"It doesn't make sense to say that President Clinton and President Nixon were given those opportunities in that parallel stage of those impeachment inquiries, because there wasn't any preliminary hearing before another committee in those inquiries,\" Stanford law professor Dave Sklansky said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"The closest analogy in the Clinton impeachment proceedings to what the House Intelligence Committee is now doing was the work of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the federal grand jury he convened.\" And Clinton, of course, did not participate in Starr\u2019s investigation, which took place outside the House. Just as Nixon wasn\u2019t involved in the investigation preceding his impeachment proceedings. Sarah Binder , professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the liberal Brookings Institute, called it an apples and oranges comparison. \"I think it's fair to think of the (Intelligence Committee) investigation as the rough equivalent to those behind-closed-door Clinton and Nixon investigations,\" Binder said in an email. In other words, those presidents didn\u2019t have any due process protections at that stage that are now withheld from Trump. On Trump and due process Steil\u2019s team is correct that the ability to punish Trump for a lack of cooperation is novel, Binder said. Here\u2019s the description of that point from the Congressional Record : Should the President unlawfully refuse to make witnesses available for testimony to, or to produce documents requested by, the investigative committees ... the chair shall have the discretion to impose appropriate remedies, including by denying specific requests by the President or his counsel under these procedures to call or question witnesses. But Binder questioned whether it\u2019s fair to summarize that as not having due process protections. \"It doesn't per se mean \u2026 that President Trump has fewer procedural protections than did his predecessors,\" Binder said in an email. \"It does mean that should the president fail to cooperate, he could be penalized by the committee for such behavior.\""

        "statement": "Marijuana has a unique impact on the developing brain. It can prime your brain for addiction to other substances.",
        "explanation": "While some preclinical studies with rodents suggest marijuana may prime the brain for addiction to other substances, experts highlight that these findings cannot be conclusively applied to humans. Human studies are limited, and other risk factors like peer influence and sociodemographic predispositions complicate the association. Additionally, marijuana's neurological impact is not uniquely deleterious compared to other substances like alcohol or nicotine.",
        "evidences": [
            "We contacted the surgeon general\u2019s office, which directed us to statements from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. NIDA noted that marijuana may have a gateway effect, but that most people who use the drug don\u2019t progress to other, harder substances; and that alcohol and nicotine appear to have a similar impact. The idea that marijuana can \"prime your brain for addiction\" has some basis: namely, the results of some studies conducted with rodents. For instance, Adams\u2019 office noted that preclinical studies indicate exposure to THC \u2013 marijuana\u2019s main psychoactive compound \u2013\u00a0 during a period roughly equivalent to adolescence in rats resulted in greater self-administration of heroin when the animals reach adulthood. In addition, THC exposure yielded changes in their brains\u2019 reward system \u2013 in other words, yes, priming the brain for the rewarding effects of opioids. But, Isen said, it\u2019s scientifically problematic to draw a line from the effects seen in rodents to what might be happening to a human. \"We should remain agnostic about the surgeon general\u2019s claim,\" Isen argued. Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa., took a more optimistic view of that research, arguing that the animal evidence is \"very clear\" when it comes to marijuana\u2019s neurological impact. \"What we know is strong enough to say that exposure during adolescence when the brain is developing is a risk,\" said Susan Weiss, a scientific adviser to the NIDA director. But how meaningful of a risk \u2013 and how it compares to other drugs \u2013 is exceptionally tough to say, given the limitations on research. Studies on actual humans are limited because people who use marijuana at a young age may be exposed to other risk factors, such as peer influences using harder drugs, or sociodemographic factors that might predispose them to abuse or addiction. As Dr. Sue Sisley, an Arizona-based psychiatrist who tracks the state of marijuana research, put it: \"I don\u2019t see very much good, rigorous data to confirm either way.\" In the most narrow sense, marijuana indeed has a \"unique\" effect on the brain. It elicits a response from what are called \"endocannabinoid receptors.\" Other drugs don\u2019t \u2013 they interact with different brain receptors. On a practical level, Isen said, while one could highlight the distinct scientific effect marijuana has, \"there is no evidence that marijuana has a uniquely deleterious effect on the developing brain - certainly not more than other substances such as alcohol.\""

In his 1957 manifesto , he included: \"Immediate initiation of an intensive campaign against illiteracy, and civic education emphasizing the duties and rights of each citizen to his society and fatherland.\" In 1961, about a quarter of a million teachers fanned out across the island nation. Their ranks included formally trained teachers and members of such groups as the National \u00a0 Federation of Sugar Workers, the Rebel Youth Association and the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces.

        "explanation": "The evidence indicates that the claim did not consistently pan out as millions of Americans' private insurance plans were canceled under the Affordable Care Act due to regulations. Moreover, private insurance availability is subject to market forces, regulatory changes, and carrier decisions, making it impossible to guarantee that people can keep their private plans.",
        "evidences": [
            "Arguing in favor of the Affordable Care Act, then-President Barack Obama repeatedly said the health law would let people keep their private health plans, if they liked them. That didn\u2019t pan out: Millions of Americans\u2019 plans were canceled, spawning months of controversy. He suggests many Americans would be able to pick between buying private insurance or opting into the government plan. But does that mean that if you like your plan, you can keep it? The problem is that private insurance availability isn\u2019t up to the government. To be sure, state and federal regulators have the power to dictate, for example, the inclusion of certain benefits and to set basic consumer protections. But the government cannot specifically require insurance companies to offer plans, and any carrier has the option to stop providing coverage. Already, market forces dictate what health insurance is available from year to year. It\u2019s impossible to predict, but a competing public option might change the financial incentives for those plans and push some of those carriers to abandon the exchange. If that happened, people using that plan would lose the insurance they have, regardless of how they feel about it. So, she added, suggesting that people who like their private plans will have the option to keep them under Buttigieg\u2019s proposal is \"probably not true.\" In 2019, 53% of employers providing coverage considered changing the plan or the carrier they offered, according to a KFF survey . Of that group, almost a fifth \u2014 18% \u2015 ultimately did change insurance carriers. That flux would likely increase under a plan like Buttigieg\u2019s."

        "explanation": "The evidence shows that the wage of $12.75 per hour offered by the Amazon distribution center does not equate to hourly wages from 30 years ago, either in direct comparison or when adjusted for inflation. Median wages from 30 years ago were higher, even after inflation adjustments, at $20.02 per hour compared to $12.75. While the evidence supports the idea of stagnant wage growth, the specific numerical claim made is not supported.",
        "evidences": [
            "Dennis Winters, chief economist for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, said the best metric to use in examining the claim is median wages \u2014 and, of course, to examine them in \"real\" terms, to compare the spending power over time. The median wage for Americans in December 1990 was $417 per week, which breaks down to $10.43 an hour. Fast-forward three decades, and the median wage for Americans in December 2019 was $933 per week, or $23.33 an hour. That might look like a significant increase. But using the Bureau\u2019s inflation calculator, the 1990 weekly wage translates to $800.88 per week in today\u2019s dollars, or $20.02 an hour. So, that\u2019s a roughly $3 increase in 30 years. From a narrow perspective, Pocan is off \u2014 an offer of $12.75 does not equate to hourly wages from 30 years ago, as a straight comparison or with inflation factored in. He fares much better when considering the larger point being made: That wage growth has been largely stagnant. An August 2018 study from the Pew Research Center showed that at least since 2000, most of the country\u2019s wage growth is distributed among the top 10% of earners. For those closer to the median and below it, the growth line is nearly flat. What\u2019s more, the cost of living has undergone a much steeper hike: from 1983 to 2013, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a roughly 3% annual increase in rent and food prices, and a 1.3% annual increase in new vehicle prices. So, a small growth in median wages is dwarfed next to the rise in cost of other goods."

Additionally, the investigation into Burisma was reportedly dormant during his tenure. While Democrats pursued impeachment for Trump's actions involving Ukraine, the ad oversimplifies the context of impeachment by framing it as solely about Biden-related investigations.",
        "evidences": [
            "Biden did call for Ukraine to fire Shokin, but the ad fails to note that there were widespread calls for his ouster. Biden assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine after a popular revolution in early 2014 that led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Shokin became top prosecutor in 2015, after Yanukovych went into exile. A frustrated Biden in Dec. 2015 threatened to withhold $1 billion unless Shokin was fired, in hopes that a new prosecutor would do more to enforce the law. According to Biden, it worked. When Shokin was fired in the spring of 2016, press reports explicitly linked his ouster to corruption. Steven Pifer, a career foreign service officer who held positions in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, previously told PolitiFact that \"virtually everyone\" he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine \"felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired.\" \"All decent people were in favor of Shokin's sacking,\" Anders \u00c5slund, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council told PolitiFact. \"Biden led a Western/anticorruption consensus.\" Recently, Shokin said in a statement that his refusal to formally close the investigations led to his ouster. But Vitaliy Kasko, who served as Shokin\u2019s deputy overseeing international cooperation until he resigned in protest, told Bloomberg in 2019 that, under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma remained dormant. Kasko said the matter was \"shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015,\" and Bloomberg reported that documents backed up his account.

In a previous story , we found that the man on the far left of the frame is Devon Archer. In 2008, Hunter Biden joined with Archer \u2014 a former senior adviser for the presidential campaign of John Kerry in 2004 \u2014 in a string of investment and consulting firms. The Wall Street Journal reported in May 2014 that the two had joined Burisma as board members. That role is different from \"boss\" or \"executive,\" as Trump has claimed in separate tweets about the photo of Archer. The fourth man in the photo that Trump tweeted is Ralph Pascucci, founder of Netrex Capital Markets LLC, a New York investment banking firm. He is also a principal of Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, N.Y., where the Bidens spent a week in August 2014. In his Nickelback video, Trump showed a clip of Biden saying he had \"never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\" contrasting that with the photograph of the golf group. That\u2019s different than claiming he had never spoken to Burisma. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker magazine in July 2019 that he discussed Burisma with his father one time in December 2015."

The questions in these polls did not identify the ideas as being backed by Sanders, and they offered basic descriptions of the plans, without mentioning complications, such as the cost involved. The data shows that \u2014 contrary to what Buttigieg said \u2014 a large share of Democrats support Sanders\u2019 economic proposals, according to polls. Among Democrats, single-payer health care receives upwards of 58% support, the Green New Deal gets 86%, a $15 minimum wage gets 84%, tuition-free college gets 76%, student-loan forgiveness gets 79%, breaking up big banks gets 60%, and paid family leave gets 94%. Paid family leave got 84% support, while the other policies had support levels in the 53% to 63% range among all voters."

Evidence shows only one documented DUI arrest, which was handled in court without evidence of intervention by his father. Additionally, the claim about hospice fraud involving Matt Gaetz is unsupported; the fraud case pertains to a company formerly owned by his father, and Matt Gaetz was neither involved nor named in the lawsuit.",

            "The Facebook post takes a single arrest for DUI, inflates it and omits that the case was dropped. Also, the hospice fraud case pertains to a company that was once owned by Matt Gaetz\u2019s father Don Gaetz, who wasn\u2019t named as a defendant in that case. Here\u2019s what happened, according to the Tampa Bay Times : When Gaetz was 26, he was driving back from a nightclub on Okaloosa Island in a BMW registered to his father, then-Florida Sen. Don Gaetz. Okaloosa County Deputy Chris Anglin clocked Gaetz traveling 48 mph in a 35 mph. Anglin reported that Gaetz\u2019s eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he swayed and staggered when he got out of the car and smelled of alcohol. Gaetz, a lawyer, admitted he had consumed two beers but declined field sobriety tests. He was arrested and refused the breath test. We did not find evidence that Gaetz\u2019s father Don \"got him off\" of the arrest, as the post says. Gaetz\u2019s lawyer filed a motion to drop the case. The prosecutor agreed to drop the case in December 2008, court records show . Florida Department of Law Enforcement records note only one arrest for Gaetz, in October 2008, related to a DUI misdemeanor traffic offense. Snopes , which debunked a meme about Gaetz\u2019s DUI record in July, found that the earliest version of the claim stemmed from a 2016 post by a conspiracy theorist . Vitas fraud case didn\u2019t involve Matt Gaetz The Facebook post goes on to say \"he was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud.\" That leaves the impression that \"he\" refers to Matt Gaetz, which is wrong. It was Don Gaetz\u2019s former company, Vitas Healthcare Corporation, that was involved in litigation involving fraud. It didn\u2019t involve Matt Gaetz, and the elder Gaetz was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit. In 2013, the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Chemed Corporation and hospice subsidiaries, including Vitas Hospice Services LLC and Vitas Healthcare Corporation, alleging false Medicare billings for hospice services.

            "Pelosi\u2019s claim that Republicans are getting more rights comes down to two measures: the number of lawmakers involved, and their power to call witnesses and ask them questions. On the first, Pelosi\u2019s staff say there are twice as many committees involved and so, twice as many minority party lawmakers. That is accurate compared with past impeachments, however, compared with what has taken place so far, the resolution\u2019s focus on the two committees means that several other committees will now play smaller roles. Many Republicans on committees such as Oversight and Foreign Affairs have been able to participate when key witnesses testified. They will lose that under this resolution. For the Nixon and Clinton proceedings, all the action was in the House Judiciary Committee. The rules laid out in the House resolution and by the Judiciary Committee chair give Republicans equal time to question witnesses. It does so in more detail than in the Nixon and Clinton House resolutions. In 1974 and 1998 , members of both parties could call witnesses. Either side could object to a witness, in which case, the dispute would ultimately be resolved by committee vote. Today, the Republicans lack the power to challenge a Democratic subpoena. The practical impact is less telling, because in the past as in the present, the majority party always has the votes to win at the committee level."

On March 7, 2005, volunteers counted 4,395 street homeless people for the inaugural Homeless Outreach Population Estimate, or HOPE count. On Jan. 28, 2013, the last year of Bloomberg's tenure, the count was\u00a03,180. The count on Jan. 27, 2014, a month after Bloomberg left office, was 3,357, or a drop of 24 percent from 2005. While the counting methodology does account for including some people the counters may have missed, the data can be unreliable, according to some experts. In a paper published by the\u00a0conservative American Enterprise Institute, Kevin C.

But while other Republicans specified that the Washington Times article counted congressional subpoenas against House bills that were ultimately signed into law, Shields was less precise, instead comparing subpoenas issued to bills passed. In fact, House Democrats have helped pass more than 500 bills and resolutions, although many have not made their way to Trump\u2019s desk. When we reached out to Shields, he said he \"misspoke,\" and he later clarified his point on Twitter . \"I meant to say more subpoenas than laws that have been passed, not bills,\" he told us. Experts said it\u2019s meaningless to compare subpoenas with House bills enacted into law, because while a committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, there are more hurdles when it comes to legislation. The House can\u2019t make laws by itself Experts said the biggest problem with the subpoenas-to-bills comparison is the lack of attention it pays to the Senate\u2019s role in sending House-backed bills to the president\u2019s desk. \"The House can't pass \u2018bills into law\u2019 by itself,\" said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University.

The new numbers showed between 2015 and 2016, the Obama administration had an average business investment growth of 0.7%.

When bringing Trump\u2019s term to the overall latest numbers, overall growth has been about 4.9%. Tara Sinclair, an economics professor at George Washington University, said average growth rates for business investment look stronger in recent years, but when measured as a share of Gross Domestic Product the picture is very similar under both administrations. Sinclair said GOP policies that cut regulations may have helped lead to stronger business investment under the Trump administration, but it\u2019s hard to blame or credit a presidential administration for most economic outcomes. \"As you can see from the data, the quarterly growth rates are quite volatile, so more data to identify a clear trend will be helpful,\" Sinclair told us."

Other states give private sellers the option of going through law enforcement directly for the background check. The record-keeping requirements vary, with some states leaving that to the individual selling the gun and others requiring transfers be reported to local law enforcement. The state Department of Justice handles background checks for handgun sales , while long gun sales go through the National Criminal Background Check Systems , run by the FBI. The FBI conducts the background check but is required by federal law to destroy identifying information on the purchaser and gun within 24 hours. So under a comprehensive system, serial numbers would \u2014 eventually \u2014 make it to a government agency. But it is typically decades before that happens, and the agency is then prohibited from turning those into a database. Would a gun registry violate the Second Amendment?

Other data highlights problem with Williams\u2019 claim The Austin Police Department provided figures about all arrests for driving while intoxicated on I-35, but could not provide information about immigration status. From Aug. 1, 2018, to Aug. 31 of this year, there were 6,182 bookings into the county jail on new DWI arrests. Of those arrests, 7.4% of those individuals had an ICE detainer. Of all the DWI cases that went before the court in fiscal year 2018, about 20% involved people who were not U.S. citizens. It\u2019s unclear what percentage of that group were people who were in the country illegally."

            "Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff knew more about the makings of a whistleblower complaint against President Donald Trump than he let on, according to reporting from the New York Times. But Republicans, including Trump, who have seized on the Times reporting have erred in claiming the reporting suggests Schiff helped write the complaint itself. The Times did not report that Schiff helped write, or devised the complaint. The Times reporting, which relied on anonymous sources and has been corroborated by the Washington Post, shows that the whistleblower approached one of Schiff\u2019s aides with only a vague accusation against Trump. The aide told the CIA officer to find a lawyer and then told Schiff some of what the whistleblower told them. The aide did not share the officer\u2019s identity with Schiff. What the whistleblower and Schiff say Schiff did receive some information about the whistleblower complaint before it was formally presented to Congress. But both the House Intelligence Committee and a lawyer representing the whistleblower told us the complaint was drafted independently of Schiff\u2019s input, and we could find no evidence to the contrary. At the same time, Trump and Republicans have produced no evidence to suggest Schiff had helped draft or shape the complaint. He said he also can\u2019t comment on what Schiff knew about the whistleblower\u2019s concerns, but that the officer \"drafted the complaint entirely on their own.\" \"To be unequivocally clear, no member or congressional staff had any input into or reviewed the complaint before it was submitted to the intelligence community inspector general. Nor has the whistleblower or the legal team met with or even discussed this complaint with congressman Schiff.\""
