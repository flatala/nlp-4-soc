      "Rotating bolt is a method of locking used in firearms. Johann Nicolaus von Dreyse developed the first rotating bolt firearm, the \"Dreyse needle gun\" in 1836. The Dreyse locked using the bolt handle rather than lugs on the bolt head like the Mauser M 98 or M16. The first rotating bolt rifle with two lugs on the bolt head was the Lebel Model 1886 rifle. The concept has been implemented on most firearms chambered for high powered cartridges since the 20th century.",
      "The Lebel Model 1886 rifle (French: Fusil Mod\u00e8le 1886 dit \"Fusil Lebel\") is also known as the \"Fusil Mle 1886 M93\", after a bolt modification was added in 1893. It is an 8\u00a0mm bolt action infantry rifle that entered service in the French Army in 1887. It is a repeating rifle that can hold eight rounds in its forestock tube magazine, one round in the transporter plus one round in the chamber. The Lebel rifle has the distinction of being the first military firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition. The new propellant powder, \"\"Poudre B\",\" was nitrocellulose-based and had been invented in 1884 by French chemist Paul Vieille. Lieutenant Colonel Nicolas Lebel contributed a flat nosed 8\u00a0mm full metal jacket bullet (\"\"Balle M\",\" or \"\"Balle Lebel\"\"). Twelve years later, in 1898, a solid brass pointed (spitzer) and boat-tail bullet called \"\"Balle D\"\" was retained for all 8mm Lebel ammunition. Each case was protected against accidental percussion inside the tube magazine by a primer cover and by a circular groove around the primer cup which caught the tip of the following pointed bullet. Featuring an oversized bolt with front locking lugs and a massive receiver, the Lebel rifle was a durable design capable of long range performance. In spite of early obsolete features, such as its tube magazine and the shape of 8mm Lebel rimmed ammunition, the Lebel rifle remained the basic weapon of French line infantry during World War I (1914\u20131918).

      "\"Highwayman\" is a song written by American singer-songwriter Jimmy Webb, about a soul with incarnations in four different places in time and history: as a highwayman, a sailor, a construction worker on the Hoover Dam, and finally as a captain of a starship. The song was influenced by the real-life hanged highwayman Jonathan Wild. The dam builder verse alludes to the deaths of over one hundred men during the construction of Hoover Dam near Boulder City, Nevada. Webb first recorded the song on his album \"El Mirage\", released in May 1977. The following year, Glen Campbell recorded his version, which was released on his 1979 album \"Highwayman\". In 1985, the song became the inspiration for the naming of the supergroup The Highwaymen, which featured Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson. Their first album, \"Highwayman\", became a number one platinum-selling album, and their version of the song went to number one on the Hot Country Songs \"Billboard\" chart in a twenty-week run. Their version earned Webb a Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1986. The song has since been recorded by other artists. Webb himself included a different version on his 1996 album \"Ten Easy Pieces\", a live version on his 2007 album \"Live and at Large\", and a duet version with Mark Knopfler on 2010 album \"Just Across the River\"."

While the play focuses on justice overall, the final scene illustrates that Shakespeare intended for moral justice to temper strict civil justice: a number of the characters receive understanding and leniency, instead of the harsh punishment to which they, according to the law, could have been sentenced."

He was the son of organist Cristoforo Benvenuti and studied at the Liceo Musicale in Bologna under Luigi Torchi (musicology) and Marco Enrico Bossi (organ). In 1919 his collection of songs for voice and piano accompaniment, \"Canti a una voce : con accompagnamento di pianoforte\", was published in Bologna. In 1922 he published a collection of 17th-century art songs entitled \"35 Arie di vari autori del secolo XVII\". Composer Samuel Barber studied the works of Giulio Caccini, Andrea Falconieri, and other early Italian composers under his tutelage in Milan in 1933-1934. For the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma he adapted Claudio Monteverdi's \"L'Orfeo\" for a production which premiered on 27 December 1934. The adaptation was later used for the first recording of \"L'Orfeo\" in 1939, which included a performance by the orchestra of La Scala Milan under conductor Ferrucio Calusio."

It combined modern aesthetics, fine craftsmanship and expensive materials, and became the symbol of luxury and modernity. While rarely used in residences, it was frequently used for office buildings, government buildings, train stations, movie theaters, diners and department stores. It also was frequently used in furniture, and in the design of automobiles, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as toasters and radio sets. In the late 1930s, during the Great Depression, it featured prominently in the architecture of the immense public works projects sponsored by the Works Progress Administration and the Public Works Administration, such as the Golden Gate Bridge and Hoover Dam. The style competed throughout the period with the modernist architecture, and came to an abrupt end in 1939 with the beginning of World War II.

The turnover pulse hypothesis is significant because it extends the geographic radiation concept from a single to a multi-clade context.

The majority of turnover pulses that occur result in small peaks affecting a small number of species, and typically involve a small geographic area.

Russian publications indicate that the term West Siberian Laika loosely applied to hunting dogs originating with the Mansi and Khanty people in Ural and West Siberia, but there were no standards or registrations of WSL as such until 1930. Then WWll disrupted it for a while, but \"systematic breeding with registrations\" resumed after the war ended, in 1946. This was the time the breed began taking modern shape. Before that hunters only knew of Mansi Laika and Khanty Laika. In early 1960 many hunters in Ural still preferred the term Mansi Laika, when speaking of West Siberian Laika. In Russian language, the term Laika originated from the word \"layat\" that means to bark. The word Laika simply means \"barker\". Any hunting Laika is a bark pointer (pointing at animal of interest by barking and staying with the animal ). It is a versatile dog depending on use and environment, but in certain parts of the country they have become more specialized."

The Albanian leadership under Enver Hoxha perceived Khrushchev's policies as contrary to Marxist\u2013Leninist doctrine and his denunciation of Joseph Stalin as an opportunistic act meant to legitimize revisionism within the international communist movement. Occurring within the context of the larger split between China and the USSR, the Soviet\u2013Albanian split culminated in the rupturing of relations in 1961.",

Khrushchev was responsible for the de-Stalinization of the Soviet Union, for backing the progress of the early Soviet space program, and for several relatively liberal reforms in areas of domestic policy.

As Miss America 2014, she was also the \"first contestant of Indian descent to win the Miss America Competition\" (as well as the second Asian American). Shortly after becoming Miss America, however, Davuluri became the target of xenophobic and racist commentary in social media. Her win also instigated dialogue in India and the Indian diaspora over the topic of colorism. Davuluri drew upon these experiences to promote her platform \"Celebrating Diversity Through Cultural Competency\" during her year as Miss America. Since ending her reign as Miss America in September 2014, Davuluri has continued to travel throughout the United States and India as a speaker and advocate for diversity, gender equality, and the promotion of STEM education."

He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". He released his debut album, \"The Voice of Frank Sinatra\", in 1946. Sinatra's professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known performers as part of the Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of \"From Here to Eternity\", with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including \"In the Wee Small Hours\" (1955), \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers!\" (1956), \"Come Fly with Me\" (1958), \"Only the Lonely\" (1958) and \"Nice 'n' Easy\" (1960)."

      "\"Mmm Papi\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Britney Spears. The song was written by Spears and Nicole Morier, while additional writing and song production were done by Canadian band Let's Go to War, whose members are Henry Walter, Adrien Gough and Peter-John Kerr, for Spears' sixth studio album, \"Circus\" (2008). \"Mmm Papi\" is noted for having a Latin pop influence, similar to Madonna's \"La Isla Bonita\" (1987). The lyrics of the song tell about a woman who has an attraction to a man, longing for him to come and take her away.",
      "\"La Isla Bonita\" (English: The Beautiful Island ) is a song by American singer Madonna from her third studio album \"True Blue\" (1986). She and Patrick Leonard co-wrote and co-produced the song, and Bruce Gaitsch provided additional songwriting. Sire Records released it as the album's final single on February 25, 1987. The instrumental version of the song was first offered to Michael Jackson before Madonna both accepted it and wrote the lyrics and melody. \"La Isla Bonita\" is noted for being the first Madonna song to contain Latino influences, with arrangements of Cuban drums and Spanish guitar, maracas, harmonicas and a mix of synthesized and real drumming. The lyrics of the song tell about a \"beautiful island\" and according to Madonna, was a tribute to the beauty of the Latin people.",
      "\"Whiplash\" is a song by American band Selena Gomez & the Scene, from their third studio album \"When the Sun Goes Down\" (2011). The song was originally written by Britney Spears; after she started working on her sixth studio album \"Circus\" (2008), Spears contacted Nicole Morier to write songs with her. Together, they wrote \"Mmm Papi\", \"Rock Me In\" and \"Whiplash\". The latter, which was produced by co-writer Greg Kurstin, failed to make the album. In 2011, Selena Gomez recorded the song with her band for \"When the Sun Goes Down\".",
