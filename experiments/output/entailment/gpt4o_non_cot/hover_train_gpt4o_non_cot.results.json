      "Rotating bolt is a method of locking used in firearms. Johann Nicolaus von Dreyse developed the first rotating bolt firearm, the \"Dreyse needle gun\" in 1836. The Dreyse locked using the bolt handle rather than lugs on the bolt head like the Mauser M 98 or M16. The first rotating bolt rifle with two lugs on the bolt head was the Lebel Model 1886 rifle. The concept has been implemented on most firearms chambered for high powered cartridges since the 20th century.",
      "The Lebel Model 1886 rifle (French: Fusil Mod\u00e8le 1886 dit \"Fusil Lebel\") is also known as the \"Fusil Mle 1886 M93\", after a bolt modification was added in 1893. It is an 8\u00a0mm bolt action infantry rifle that entered service in the French Army in 1887. It is a repeating rifle that can hold eight rounds in its forestock tube magazine, one round in the transporter plus one round in the chamber. The Lebel rifle has the distinction of being the first military firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition. The new propellant powder, \"\"Poudre B\",\" was nitrocellulose-based and had been invented in 1884 by French chemist Paul Vieille. Lieutenant Colonel Nicolas Lebel contributed a flat nosed 8\u00a0mm full metal jacket bullet (\"\"Balle M\",\" or \"\"Balle Lebel\"\"). Twelve years later, in 1898, a solid brass pointed (spitzer) and boat-tail bullet called \"\"Balle D\"\" was retained for all 8mm Lebel ammunition. Each case was protected against accidental percussion inside the tube magazine by a primer cover and by a circular groove around the primer cup which caught the tip of the following pointed bullet. Featuring an oversized bolt with front locking lugs and a massive receiver, the Lebel rifle was a durable design capable of long range performance. In spite of early obsolete features, such as its tube magazine and the shape of 8mm Lebel rimmed ammunition, the Lebel rifle remained the basic weapon of French line infantry during World War I (1914\u20131918). Altogether, 3.45 million Lebel rifles were produced by the three French state factories between 1887 and 1916."

It emerged in 1854 to combat the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, an act that dissolved the terms of the Missouri Compromise and allowed slave or free status to be decided in the territories by popular sovereignty. The Party had almost no presence in the Southern United States, but by 1858 in the North it had enlisted former Whigs and former Free Soil Democrats to form majorities in nearly every Northern state.",

      "\"Highwayman\" is a song written by American singer-songwriter Jimmy Webb, about a soul with incarnations in four different places in time and history: as a highwayman, a sailor, a construction worker on the Hoover Dam, and finally as a captain of a starship. The song was influenced by the real-life hanged highwayman Jonathan Wild. The dam builder verse alludes to the deaths of over one hundred men during the construction of Hoover Dam near Boulder City, Nevada. Webb first recorded the song on his album \"El Mirage\", released in May 1977. The following year, Glen Campbell recorded his version, which was released on his 1979 album \"Highwayman\". In 1985, the song became the inspiration for the naming of the supergroup The Highwaymen, which featured Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson. Their first album, \"Highwayman\", became a number one platinum-selling album, and their version of the song went to number one on the Hot Country Songs \"Billboard\" chart in a twenty-week run. Their version earned Webb a Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1986. The song has since been recorded by other artists. Webb himself included a different version on his 1996 album \"Ten Easy Pieces\", a live version on his 2007 album \"Live and at Large\", and a duet version with Mark Knopfler on 2010 album \"Just Across the River\"."

Despite this, the production to the song \"Nasty Boy\" is completely different from that for \"Nasty Girl\", and apart from the lyrical sample, and the second verse (rapped by P.

It combined modern aesthetics, fine craftsmanship and expensive materials, and became the symbol of luxury and modernity. While rarely used in residences, it was frequently used for office buildings, government buildings, train stations, movie theaters, diners and department stores. It also was frequently used in furniture, and in the design of automobiles, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as toasters and radio sets. In the late 1930s, during the Great Depression, it featured prominently in the architecture of the immense public works projects sponsored by the Works Progress Administration and the Public Works Administration, such as the Golden Gate Bridge and Hoover Dam. The style competed throughout the period with the modernist architecture, and came to an abrupt end in 1939 with the beginning of World War II.

Her coverage, relatively favorable toward Batista, was often at odds with that of Herbert Matthews, the noted \"Times\" foreign correspondent who favored Castro. Personal animosity grew between them, and their contradictory coverage of the same events drew criticism from readers and media critics. Life became increasingly difficult for Phillips after the Cuban Revolution because of her anti-Castro temperament. She left Cuba for good in 1961, shortly after her home and office were raided and her Cuban colleagues were arrested. She died in Cocoa Beach, Florida at the age of 82."

      "The turnover-pulse hypothesis was constructed by paleoanthropologist Elisabeth Vrba, and is used to gauge the rate of survival and adaptation within species. The turnover-pulse hypothesis makes clear predictions regarding the responses of species to changing ecological factors. She defined turnover pulses as involving episodes of climatic change which caused geographic isolation in various taxa; the isolation subsequently spurred extinction and speciation in several different clades. The turnover pulse hypothesis is significant because it extends the geographic radiation concept from a single to a multi-clade context. The theory's key features are based on the sequence of species in the palaeontology of related genera, and environmental aspects in adaptation, survival and extinction. The majority of turnover pulses that occur result in small peaks affecting a small number of species, and typically involve a small geographic area. It is important to note that, based on Vrba and the turnover-pulse hypothesis, evolutionary change is caused by physical changes in the environment, such as climate change, tectonic plate shifting, and astronomical catastrophes, among other things."

      "The turnover-pulse hypothesis was constructed by paleoanthropologist Elisabeth Vrba, and is used to gauge the rate of survival and adaptation within species. The turnover-pulse hypothesis makes clear predictions regarding the responses of species to changing ecological factors. She defined turnover pulses as involving episodes of climatic change which caused geographic isolation in various taxa; the isolation subsequently spurred extinction and speciation in several different clades. The turnover pulse hypothesis is significant because it extends the geographic radiation concept from a single to a multi-clade context. The theory's key features are based on the sequence of species in the palaeontology of related genera, and environmental aspects in adaptation, survival and extinction. The majority of turnover pulses that occur result in small peaks affecting a small number of species, and typically involve a small geographic area. It is important to note that, based on Vrba and the turnover-pulse hypothesis, evolutionary change is caused by physical changes in the environment, such as climate change, tectonic plate shifting, and astronomical catastrophes, among other things."

      "The Soviet\u2013Albanian split refers to the worsening of relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, which occurred in the 1955\u20131961 period as a result of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's rapprochement with Yugoslavia along with his \"Secret Speech\" and subsequent de-Stalinization policies, including efforts to extend these policies into Albania as was occurring in other Eastern Bloc states at the time. The Albanian leadership under Enver Hoxha perceived Khrushchev's policies as contrary to Marxist\u2013Leninist doctrine and his denunciation of Joseph Stalin as an opportunistic act meant to legitimize revisionism within the international communist movement. Occurring within the context of the larger split between China and the USSR, the Soviet\u2013Albanian split culminated in the rupturing of relations in 1961.",
      "Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev (15 April\u00a0[O.S. 3 April]\u00a01894 \u00a0\u2013 11 September 1971) was a Soviet politician who led the Soviet Union during part of the Cold War as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, and as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, or Premier, from 1958 to 1964. Khrushchev was responsible for the de-Stalinization of the Soviet Union, for backing the progress of the early Soviet space program, and for several relatively liberal reforms in areas of domestic policy. Khrushchev's party colleagues removed him from power in 1964, replacing him with Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary and Alexei Kosygin as Premier."
