However, it could be more precise in its language, as it implies that the intrinsic signal amplification by type-iii crispr-cas systems provides a viral diagnostic without explicitly stating so.\n\nJustification: The explanation is generally faithful, but could be improved with more precision and accuracy in its wording."
