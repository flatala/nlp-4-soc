As part of the settlement, according to Reuters, the FDA agreed to alert consumers about the potential risks on its website and to issue a more specific rule about fillings that contain mercury. In a notice on its website \u2014\u00a0and this is what the Principia Scientific story quotes \u2014\u00a0the FDA said that amalgams contain mercury, which may have neurotoxic effects on the nervous systems of developing children and fetuses. \"Pregnant women and persons who may have a health condition that makes them more sensitive to mercury exposure, including individuals with existing high levels of mercury microburden, should not avoid seeking dental care, but should discuss options with their health practitioner,\" the FDA said.",

      "explanation": "The claim that Thomas Paine and Martin Luther King supported forms similar to universal basic income are supported by the evidence. Paine proposed payments that resemble a precursor to universal basic income, albeit not identical, and King explicitly mentioned guaranteed income. Additionally, the House of Representatives passed bills in 1970 and 1971 that aligned with principles akin to guaranteeing a minimal income, as mentioned in the claim. The evidence provides sufficient support for all parts of the claim.",

        "Paine wrote that Earth in its \"natural uncultivated state\" was the common property of the human race. He proposed a one-time payment of 15 pounds to every person when they turned 21 years old; and that every person aged 50, and all others who arrived at that age, be paid 10 pounds annually for the rest of their lives. Paine\u2019s proposal in the 1790s pamphlet Agrarian Justice was in some ways an early version of the Social Security program and has an element of universal basic income, said Harvey J. Kaye, a democracy and justice studies professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. But it wasn\u2019t the same thing.",
        "It is true that King supported a guaranteed income in his 1967 book, \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?\" \"I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective \u2014 the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income,\" King wrote.",
        "The New York Times in April 1970 reported that the Democrat-led House voted 243-155 for President Richard Nixon\u2019s revision of the welfare system, establishing \"for the first time the principle that the government should guarantee every family a minimum annual income, even if one or more of its members is working.\" In June 1971, the House again voted 288-132 for an omnibus bill that included a proposal to guarantee families an annual income. Another key point about the Nixon plan: It was based on a negative income tax model, meaning the total amount distributed would have depended on recipients\u2019 income level. Universal basic income proposals, like Yang\u2019s, seek to give everyone a flat amount, regardless of how much money they make."

The lawsuit alleged that Booker\u2019s lack of oversight led to the agency\u2019s mismanagement. A federal judge disagreed and, in June 2016, Booker\u2019s name was dropped from the lawsuit. The judge ruled that Booker was immune from liability since his chairmanship was a function of his mayorship. \"Because there is no dispute that Booker was acting as a public employee in serving on the Board, and no argument that his actions (or inactions) as a member of the Board were other than discretionary and/or legislative in nature and required the exercise of his judgment, the Court finds that Booker is immune under N.J.S.A.",

Booker\u2019s spokespeople told the New York Post at the time that the money wasn\u2019t a salary, but part of a \"separation agreement\" with the firm. The Daily Beast reported the agreement was paid out for work Booker did for the firm before he became mayor.",

The Post reported that, as of 2013, Trenk had made $212,318 from the watershed. According to a review of existing media reports and court records, there is no evidence of a money laundering scheme involving the two entities."

Section 1498 provides authority to bypass patents if the price is too high, which can apply to drugs like insulin and EpiPens.

Bayh-Dole, the law that created march-in rights, suggests the government can \"march in\" when a drug isn\u2019t available amid concerns over public health, such as an epidemic. It applies only to pharmaceuticals for which the government holds all the patents because it funded the research that led to their development.

In the past, the term was indeed roughly equivalent to what many consider grade level, said Alan Borsuk , a senior fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University Law School and longtime education reporter and columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. But that changed in 2013 when Wisconsin dramatically raised the achievement level needed to reach the \"proficient\" threshold. Can it still be equated to grade level as Thiesfeldt does? \"The answer is quite emphatically no,\" Borsuk said. He elaborated in his Sept. 13, 2019, Journal Sentinel column . \"I\u2019m increasingly willing to lump \u2018basic\u2019 with \u2018proficient\u2019 and \u2018advanced\u2019 to get a rough measure of whether kids are on grade level,\" Borsuk wrote. \"And if you do that, you come up with \u2014 to give one example \u2014 about three-quarters for Wisconsin public school students in third through eighth grade rated as basic or better in English language arts (often just called reading), which certainly looks better than saying well below half are proficient.\" Tom Loveless , a former senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who authored the group\u2019s annual report on education trends for 16 years, said he agreed with Borsuk that a basic rating on the state\u2019s assessment system tests is roughly equal to what the proficient rating was years ago.",

By all those measures, the claim that asylum seekers are arriving at record levels seems to check out, though not all track fear claims made at the southwest border specifically. The USCIS numbers, for instance, show that in 2006 about 5,000 migrants made credible fear claims. In 2018 , that total surged to more than 99,000.",
        "\"It\u2019s always hard to pinpoint the cause of migration flows because there are so many factors that go into these decisions to migrate,\" said Jessica Bolter, an analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. Bolter and other experts described myriad \"push factors\" leading migrants from the Northern Triangle to leave their homes, including gang violence, a precarious economy, pressures from climate change and widespread government corruption. Meanwhile, brighter economic opportunities in the strong U.S. job market and the chance to reunite with family members now living in the U.S. account for some of the main draws.",
        "Several experts also suggested Trump\u2019s rhetoric, along with his administration\u2019s moves to discourage immigration, might be driving refugees to the U.S. border by giving smugglers ammunition to persuade families to migrate now before more restrictive policies are implemented. \"When Trump came in and announced his hardline policy and intention to build a border wall, I think that itself started people heading northward to get in before the wall was built,\" said Douglas Massey, a professor at Princeton University\u2019s Office of Population Research, who has studied border migration for decades. \"So I think to some extent Trump actually encouraged the flow with his hardline tactics.\""

There are a few terms we need to break down: The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour has been in effect since 2009. Fair market rent is the 40th median percentile of rents (including utilities, but not telephone) paid by tenants who have moved in a locality during the last two years.

The national coalition defines \" affordability \" as consistent\u00a0with a federal standard that no more than 30% of a household\u2019s gross income should be spent on rent and utilities.

The groups shared the concern that the documentary spreads misinformation, and that hosting such a film \"does a disservice to the public because it may cause unwarranted alarm to the point where people might avoid a very necessary dental procedure.\" The American Dental Association added that approximately 25 million new endodontic treatments, which includes root canals, are performed safely each year.",

Daily Politics Feed, the YouTube channel responsible for the video, says all of its videos are created by transcribing the text of stories from \"alternative news sources.\" The Illicit Info article is labeled as opinion. \"It was a loan guarantee to a company with a very small investment from a firm Ronald Pelosi joined after the deal in which he had no financial stake or benefit,\" the spokesperson said, noting that Ronald Pelosi is Nancy Pelosi\u2019s brother-in-law, not brother, as the video says. Several fact-checkers and news outlets have set the record straight since the deal was announced in 2011, including FactCheck.org , Snopes , the San Francisco Chronicle and Fortune . Each of them found that Ronald Pelosi\u2019s connection to SolarReserve, the parent company of the firm that received the loan for a project in Nevada, was blown out of proportion. According to those reports, the unsubstantiated claims first popped up shortly after the Energy Department announced in September 2011 that it would be providing a $737 loan guarantee to Tonopah Solar Energy, a subsidiary of SolarReserve, for a major solar project. At the time of the announcement, Ronald Pelosi was an \"independent director\" on the board of PCG Asset Management, a subsidiary of a private equity firm called Pacific Corporate Group, which had invested in SolarReserve, according to FactCheck.org . The $737 million sent to Tonopah Solar Energy was a loan guarantee, not a blank check, and SolarReserve told FactCheck.org and Snopes that Pacific Corporate Group\u2019s investment was a 2% share. Pelosi also provided FactCheck.org with documentation showing that he took in just $25,000 annually from his role on the board. Plus, Ronald Pelosi wasn\u2019t on the board at the time that Pacific Corporate Group made its investment in SolarReserve, according to the San Francisco Chronicle . The Chronicle reported that Pelosi didn\u2019t stand to profit from the firm\u2019s stake in SolarReserve, either."

But the 2018 data, which was available at the time,\u00a0 shows a noteworthy reversal, with the violent crime rate dropping after several years of steady increases. To address this, the FBI data notes which agencies have changed reporting practices each year and warns the crime figures are now \"not comparable to previous years\u2019 data.\" In the 2008 to 2017 period Sanfelippo referenced, the FBI flagged data from 46 Wisconsin municipalities as no longer being comparable to past years. That included three of the 10 largest cities \u2014 which you\u2019ll remember Sanfelippo cited specifically as having a 24% increase in violent crime. Using FBI crime data from 2008 and 2018 and removing the places that changed reporting practices in that span leaves us with 206 municipalities \u2014 still a solid sample size. Based on that group, the statewide violent crime rate rose from 4.3 to 4.7 per 1,000 residents from 2008 to 2018. But Milwaukee accounted for all of that change. Remove Milwaukee and the crime rate across the other 205 municipalities went from 1.77 per 1,000 to 1.74 per 1,000 \u2014 virtually unchanged. The memo said \u2014 again, based in part on data the FBI warned against comparing \u2014 that violent crime rates increased in all but two of the state\u2019s 10 largest cities. Sanfelippo instead claimed the crime rate increased in \"all but two Wisconsin cities.\" That\u2019s not even close to true. Using the 206 municipalities referenced above \u2014 those that have data for both 2008 and 2018 and haven\u2019t changed reporting practices \u2014 we find the crime rate rose in 98 municipalities, fell in 88 and was unchanged in 20.

It\u2019s also worth mentioning that the Facebook post doesn\u2019t limit itself to federal taxes. States could , and in multiple cases did , tax earnings before 1913. Before the Civil War, government funds were primarily obtained from tariffs on imports, the selling of public land and temporary excise taxes.

Instead, we found a number of reports \u2014 from fact-checkers as well as local and national news outlets \u2014 that debunked viral Facebook posts that were fooling people into believing most white vans belonged to sex traffickers. Some outlets, like Lead Stories , knocked down posts claiming white vans with external locks are the vehicle of choice for sex traffickers, noting that such locks are widely available for sale online and commonly used by workers who use expensive tools on the job. These posts reportedly took off after Baltimore Mayor Jack Young issued a warning about white vans that he claimed, without evidence, were \"trying to snatch up young girls for human trafficking.\" Young said he got word of such incidents from Facebook rather than from the Baltimore Police Department, which later told reporters it had no reports of actual incidents that involved sex traffickers driving white vans with external locks. But Robert Lowery, vice president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , told Yahoo News that \"of the 420,000 missing children last year, there were around 30 or 40 physical abductions that involved, for example, grabbing them in public.\" In a statement to PolitiFact, the Polaris Project , a nonprofit organization that works to combat human trafficking, said it hasn\u2019t identified white vans with external locks as a trend. Human trafficking often occurs between people that know each other, rather than complete strangers, and people being trafficked aren\u2019t always physically restrained, locked away or held against their will, the group said."

      "explanation": "Based on the evidence provided, Mike Bloomberg's net worth of $64.2 billion exceeds the collective wealth of the bottom 38% of American households, which together have about $6 billion in wealth. This supports the claim that Bloomberg owns more wealth than approximately 125 million Americans, calculated by multiplying 47.8 million households by the average household size of 2.63. The evidence firmly supports the claim.",

        "Bloomberg\u2019s net worth, as listed by Forbes magazine\u2019s richest list, was $64.2 billion at the time of the Feb. 19 debate. That was enough to rank him as the 12th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes . The Sanders campaign\u2019s source is a column by Matt Bruenig of the People\u2019s Policy Project , a think tank that has \"a special focus on socialist and social democratic economic ideas.\" Bruenig was more specific than Sanders, writing that by his calculation of Federal Reserve \"summary extract public data ,\" Bloomberg owns nearly six times as much wealth as the bottom 38% of households. When we contacted Bruenig, he said he used the Federal Reserve\u2019s Summary Extract Public Data , which is offered for researchers to make calculations using statistical software. Bruenig said he sorted all households from those with the least wealth to those with the most wealth. He then added the wealth of the bottom 38% of American households to get $11.4 billion. Then, he determined how many household units this accounted for and found the answer to be 47.8 million. You can then multiply the 47.8 million households by 2.63 (the average number of people per household ) to come up with 125.7 million people. Matthew Gross, a doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan with data-analyzing experience, helped PolitiFact replicate Bruenig\u2019s math. Gross found that the bottom 38% had about $6 billion in wealth, rather than Bruenig\u2019s $11.4 billion, but either way, this was enough to verify the calculation that Bloomberg had more wealth than the bottom 38% of American households combined. Meanwhile, he found that the 38th percentile alone owns about $50 billion. Together, then, percentiles 0 through 38 collectively own about $6 billion in wealth, which is less than Bloomberg had. In a technical sense, however, tens of millions of Americans join Bloomberg in owning more wealth than the bottom 37% of households combined, since the bottom 37% are collectively in the red."

Cellphones are just one factor For Rodgers\u2019 claim to be true, an overwhelming majority of teenage motor vehicle deaths would have to have been caused by cellphone use, so much so that it would still outnumber deaths caused by suicide (which account for roughly 1,000 fewer teen deaths than car crashes per year). However, texting comes nowhere close to topping the CDC\u2019s list of the leading causes of teen crashes. Driver inexperience takes first place, followed by driving with teen passengers, nighttime driving, and not using seat belts. Distracted driving (the category that texting while driving falls into) came in fifth. Further calling Rodgers\u2019 claim into doubt, cellphone use isn\u2019t even the leading cause of distracted driving. The most recent data available shows that in 2017, 271 teenagers died because of distracted driving, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Of those fatalities, only 23% \u2014 or 63 teen deaths \u2014 were caused by cellphones. There were approximately 2,500 deaths by suicide among people aged 15-19, by comparison."

Trump delivered his comment (around minute 13:30 on the C-SPAN video ) with a straight face. We didn\u2019t hear any laughter after what he said; it was news. The Q&A continued with Trump calling on a reporter who asked about the minimum wage . In the same press conference, Trump said , \"By the way, they hacked \u2014 they probably have her 33,000 emails. I hope they do. And when NBC reporter Katy Tur asked whether he was encouraging a foreign country to hack into emails, he said, \"Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them.\" Trump tweeted a similar statement after the news conference (with still no trace of an LOL). Our job is to look for whether people laughed, and whether the media deceptively left that out (and neither happened)."

Changes to Wisconsin\u2019s voter rolls When asked for evidence for Klobuchar\u2019s claim, a staffer pointed to a 2018 report from the left-leaning Center for Media and Democracy that indicated nearly 700,000 voters had been removed from the rolls since 2016. To meet a requirement under state law, the commission in 2017 removed more than 351,000 voters who hadn\u2019t voted in four years and didn\u2019t respond to a mailed notice to continue their registrations. Then, in 2018, the commission canceled the registrations of more than 300,000 voters after the agency\u2019s Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, identified voters who had become inactive or needed to update their registration. The latest election saga There is another problem with Klobuchar\u2019s statement: She said Wisconsin has purged voters \"while we are all sitting here debating.\" That suggests the issue is immediate \u2014 not one from several years ago."

Although Tillis later proposed 'The Protect Act' to address pre-existing conditions, experts claim it falls short of offering the same level of coverage as the ACA.

        "He voted to repeal the ACA, and later proposed a different law that aims to address pre-existing conditions. But experts say the Tillis plan, along with other Republican proposals, fall short of offering the coverage in the ACA. Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, insurers could deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions or inflate their premiums so much that they dropped coverage, as PolitiFact and its partners have previously reported. The Cunningham ad specifically mentions a vote from July 26, 2015: the roll call for a vote to allow the repeal of the health care law. You can see from the bill\u2019s \"statement of purpose\" that it was meant to \"repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 entirely.\" The record shows Tillis voted to repeal it. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com What Tillis said When PolitiFact reached out to the Tillis campaign, spokesman Andrew Romeo didn\u2019t dispute Tillis\u2019 vote from 2015. Romeo was referencing a bill Tillis co-sponsored known as \" The Protect Act ,\" which claims to protect people with pre-existing conditions. But experts say that bill falls short. Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow studying health reform and private insurance for the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the bill doesn\u2019t prevent insurance companies from price gouging. PolitiFact reported in 2019 that most of the Republican health care plans fail to fully protect people with pre-existing conditions. A fact-check of White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney singled out the plan proposed by Tillis and other Republican senators. It found that the bill included an option for companies to deny certain coverage if they weren\u2019t able to \"adequately\" deliver services. That fact-check quote critics of Obamacare, such as health care consultant Bob Laszewski and former Republican Senate health care policy staffer Rodney Whitlock, saying the Republican proposals fall short of the coverage offered by the ACA."

Obama said that \"even some in my own party, including my current vice president,\" critiqued the proposed raid. But the quote by Biden was more vague: \"I remember walking up to his office and saying, \u2018Look, follow your instincts, follow your instincts.\u2019\" In 2015, Biden said he did tell Obama privately to go after bin Laden. Obama-era officials said Biden expressed skepticism Biden\u2019s claim that he told Obama to \"go\" conflicted with other accounts from Obama-era officials in their books. Obama\u2019s Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote in \" Hard Choices\" that Biden \"remained skeptical.\" Panetta wrote in \" Worthy Fights \" that Biden \"argued that we still did not have enough confidence that bin Laden was in the compound, and he came out firmly in favor of waiting for more information.\" Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote in \" Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War \" that he and Biden were the \"two primary skeptics.\""

        "\"I take it that this is a printout of the Trump speech, in which case it is absurd to suggest that Pelosi can be prosecuted for doing with it whatever she pleases,\" said Heidi Kitrosser, professor of law at University of Minnesota. Since our fact-check of Kirk, Snopes and other news outlets have also concluded that Pelosi did not violate the law. So has Jonathan Turley , the George Washington University law professor who testified against impeaching Trump in the House Judiciary Committee. Even Fox News host Laura Ingraham, whose on-air commentary is typically pro-Trump, knocked the idea in an interview with Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who filed an ethics complaint against Pelosi. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The federal statute in question sets a penalty for anyone who \"conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys\" any government record \"filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States.\" The statute also says that any person with \"custody\" of a government record cannot \"willfully and unlawfully\" conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, falsify or destroy it. Experts told us Pelosi\u2019s move was not illegal because her copy of Trump\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t the official government record that would need to be preserved. The State of the Union text was never \"filed or deposited\" with her, nor did she have \"custody\" of it in the legal sense. Trump handed her and Vice President Mike Pence copies before he began speaking. (AP) \"Her copy of the State of the Union address is not a government record or government property at all,\" Douglas Cox, professor of law at the City University of New York School of Law and an expert in the laws on the preservation of government records, told us. \"It is personal property.\" Under House rules , members of Congress are encouraged to preserve their records or donate them to a research institution for historical study, Cox said. There are probably countless copies of Trump\u2019s address, such as the version the White House posted online. Pelosi\u2019s action did not preclude future generations from accessing one."

But the University of California San Francisco says in a Feb. 13 post on its website that the new coronavirus \"isn\u2019t believed to be an airborne virus, like measles or smallpox, that can circulate through the air.\" Charles Chiu, a doctor who studies infectious diseases at the university, is quoted in the post as saying: \"If you have an infected person in the front of the plane, for instance, and you\u2019re in the back of the plane, your risk is close to zero simply because the area of exposure is thought to be roughly six feet from the infected person.\" There\u2019s a difference between viruses that are transmitted by droplets and things that are aerosolized and float around in the air, according to University of Chicago Medicine. The school puts it like this : \"Think of droplets as small bits of fluid that you can see and feel when someone sneezes. You sneeze or cough and these droplets get on surfaces and then you touch them and get them on your hands, or they can fly right into your mouth or nose or eyes. That\u2019s how most coronaviruses are transmitted and that\u2019s how we think this one is too.\" Now consider an aerosol \u2014\u00a0like hairspray. You may still be able to smell it a while after someone has used it because it\u2019s lingering in the air, according to the school: \"Obviously we\u2019re learning a lot about this virus, but most coronaviruses aren\u2019t airborne this way. Generally speaking, there may be times when some of these droplets or particles are airborne, but it\u2019s limited.\""

        "Falling back on old votes When asked to provide evidence for Gallagher\u2019s claim, his press secretary Jordan Dunn pointed to the same three House roll call votes that Gallagher\u2019s colleague from southeastern Wisconsin, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, used to make a claim about impeachment about a week earlier. Like Sensenbrenner, Gallagher\u2019s office claimed that lawmakers who voted \"no\" on the motion to table the impeachment measure were actually casting a \"yes\" vote on impeachment. \"In voting to oppose tabling a measure, that is literally an expression of support for continuing consideration of a measure,\" said Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, in an email. Though one can surely argue at least some Democrats were convinced Trump had committed impeachable offenses before the Ukraine call, no one cast an \"impeachment vote\" until Dec. 18. That\u2019s when Trump was impeached over allegations he withheld aid to Ukraine and asked the country to open an investigation into the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. So Gallagher is off point on the first part of the claim. At a Sept. 23, 2017 campaign rally in Huntsville, Ala., the president said :\u00a0 \"Wouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he\u2019s fired? He\u2019s fired!\u2019\" But Green\u2019s resolution admonished Trump for \"inciting hate and hostility, and sowing discord among the people of the United States on the basis of race and gender,\" not for chastising the football league itself. Indeed, in May 2018, when the NFL released a policy warning that players who protested during the national anthem would face consequences, Trump commended the league. Moreover, that paragraph was just one of 11 instances Green cited as examples of why the president should be impeached."

We fact-checked them when they first circulated in 2018. So did Snopes and a number of local news outlets . KTLA replaced the clip on its website with a correction noting that the segment \"included factual errors about two laws going into effect in 2020 regarding water conservation.\" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The misinformation spread so far and so fast that the California Department of Water Resources and the Association of California Water Agencies both issued statements debunking it. Individuals don\u2019t have to worry about fines The false claims about California water use center on two bills \u2014 Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668 \u2014 that Brown, the state\u2019s former governor, signed into law on May 31, 2018, as California was reeling from a five-year drought that ended in 2017. Broadly speaking, the laws instruct cities, water districts and some larger agricultural water districts to establish strict water budgets. But the new water limits \u2014 which kick in starting in 2023, not 2020 \u2014 won\u2019t target individuals. \"These are not individual mandates for homeowners, but actually a task given to each water district to average water consumption use out to hit the goal,\" Kostyrko said. \"There is nothing regulating the time a person may shower or when they may or may not do laundry,\" added Jim Metropulos, legislative director for state Assemblywoman Laura Friedman, who wrote Assembly Bill 1668. In sum, fines based on consumption will be administered to the water agencies that fail to meet their goals, not to individuals who use too much water in their daily lives. Senate Bill 606 does give water agencies the ability to fine some individual lawbreakers, the Sacramento Bee noted. But that\u2019s only when they violate local water-use limits during an official \"water shortage emergency\" that threatens \"human consumption, sanitation, and fire protection.\""

Qassem Soleimani was indeed designated as a terrorist by the U.S. Treasury Department under President Obama, primarily based on his role as the commander of the Quds Force. While Obama did take some actions, such as imposing financial restrictions and sanctions against Soleimani, it is accurate to say he did not pursue a capture or kill mission against him, in contrast to his successor's later actions.

        "Like President George W. Bush before him, Obama did not capture or kill Soleimani after a designation was placed him. And a series of designations, escalated under Obama, made it more difficult for Soleimani to travel and conduct financial transactions. Obama didn\u2019t take action against Soleimani beyond that. The U.S. Treasury Department designated him in May 2011 for his role as the commander of the Quds Force, \"the primary conduit for Iran's support to the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate.\" The more serious move came in October 2011, when Treasury designated Soleimani again, saying he oversaw the Quds Force officers who plotted an attempt to assassinate Adel Al-Jubeir, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. \"I am unaware of any capture or kill mission that was publicly revealed against Soleimani by the Obama administration,\" Behnam Ben Taleblu , senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told us. Similarly, after Soleimani\u2019s death, Derek Chollet, assistant secretary of defense from 2012 to 2015, told the Daily Beast: \"To my knowledge, there was never a decision of \u2018We\u2019ve gotta go find this guy and get him.\u2019\" That comment was echoed by retired Gen. David Petraeus, the CIA director under Obama, on CBS\u2019 \"Face the Nation.\" But it goes too far to say that Obama didn\u2019t do anything, given that the designations themselves carried some force \u2014 for example, restricting Soleimani\u2019s ability to travel and finance his operations. \"The sanctions reflect the fact that the Obama administration took a number of steps \u2014 some seen many others unseen \u2014 to constrain Soleimani\u2019s activities,\" said Ned Price , who served as special assistant to Obama for national security affairs and was referred to us by an Obama spokesman. From 2011 on, Price argued, American service members and diplomats in Iraq were not attacked by Iranian proxies and militias as they have been since May 2018, when Trump implemented his maximum pressure strategy on Iran."

Fulks\u2019 phrasing on WTTW was less than clear. That said, the overall context of his remarks in that portion of the interview do suggest he was referring to those who actually pay the top rate he cited. His spokesperson cited a finding from a 2018 report by researchers at the Stanford Center on Poverty & Inequality that shows net migration of millionaires overall since 2007 has remained positive. However, the study also found \u2014\u00a0based on an analysis that compared migration changes with a control group of high earners not subject to the top rate \u2014 that the 2012 increase did indeed lead to a small loss of 0.04% of California\u2019s millionaire population. \"Our overall conclusion is, yes, millionaires do sometimes move to lower-tax states \u2014 as we see for California in 2012,\" researcher Cristobal Young told us in an email. \"In 2012, there was a large tax increase that produced millionaire out-migration \u2014 but by an amount that was too small to matter for overall state revenues or tax policy,\" he said. Using the same set of tax data, researchers at Stanford\u2019s conservative Hoover Institution found a larger increase in the rate of departures among top earners after 2012. Their report defined a departing taxpayer more broadly than Young and his colleague did and did not address net migration. Meanwhile, reports by California\u2019s nonpartisan legislative research arm and the Sacramento Bee have found that since the early 2000s, the state has gained rather than lost residents making over $100,000."

If McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won and could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court.\u201d",

Evidence confirms Bloomberg's substantial financial support for Toomey (though slightly less than $12 million mentioned), but whether this influenced the election outcome is uncertain. Evidence also highlights that even if McGinty had won, the Senate would have a 50-50 split, likely resulting in Republican control due to the Vice President's tie-breaking vote. While a McGinty win could possibly have altered Kavanaugh's confirmation, this outcome remains speculative due to the influence of the Vice President's deciding vote in a tied Senate. Thus, the claim's suggestion of definite outcomes is exaggerated and not fully supported.",

      "evidences": [
        "We found that Bloomberg did spend millions to help Toomey; whether that changed the outcome of the election is anybody\u2019s guess. But the post exaggerates when it says the race had the power to change the Supreme Court. Toomey backed legislation to expand checks to online sales and gun shows \u2014 a position shared by Bloomberg, who helped launch the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety . A New York Times analysis of Bloomberg\u2019s donations stated that he spent $11.7 million to support Toomey in 2016. We used the database of donations posted by the Center for Responsive Politics and found that Bloomberg\u2019s Independence USA PAC spent $5.9 million in support of Toomey in 2016. At the beginning of 115th Congress in January 2017, there were 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and 2 independents who caucused with the Democrats. When Alabama Democrat Doug Jones took office in January 2018, that gave Republicans a 51-49 lead . If McGinty had won, the Senate would have ended up at 50-50. Washington University political scientist Steve Smith said that there are Senate precedents that allow the vice president\u2019s party \u2014 in this case Mike Pence \u2014 to be treated as the majority party. However the majority leader was the Republican leader. If the Senate found itself in another 50-50 split, that would lead to another round of negotiations. \"The Democrats would not control the Senate in the case of a 50-50 division,\" he said. If the vice president was Republican, the majority leader would be Republican.\" Senate vote on Kavanaugh Now that brings us to the part of the Facebook post that said after Jones won, if McGinty had also won, the Democrats \"could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court.\" This statement does have a qualifier of \"could,\" but if it assumes that a McGinty win alone could have changed the outcome. The Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh in October 2018. If we take the hypothetical scenario of McGinty beating Toomey, and assume she would have followed Democratic Party lines, and all other senators would have voted in the same way as they actually did, the vote would have tied 49-49. That means that Pence could have cast a deciding vote . Other scenarios are equally hypothetical."

However, infanticide is illegal, and there is no evidence provided that supports the legalization or endorsement of post-birth abortion by Democrats.

        "To be clear: killing an infant after birth is illegal, and people on both sides of the abortion debate agree that this act should be illegal. Under federal law, the definitions of a person, human being, child and individual all include infants \"born alive at any stage of development.\" In Virginia, a woman can choose to obtain an abortion through the end of the second trimester of pregnancy, up to 28 weeks from her last menstrual period. The bill Virginia lawmakers considered in 2019 proposed multiple changes to state laws addressing abortion, including the provision regulating the procedure in the third trimester. The proposal would have lowered the number of physicians required to authorize a third-trimester abortion from three to one and remove the \"substantial and irremediable\" threshold in the law. But days later, Tran said she misspoke : \"I should have said: \u2018Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.\u2019\" A spokeswoman for Cruz pointed to the language of Tran\u2019s bill and said it clearly allows abortion up until the moment of birth, but Tran\u2019s bill only changed the requirements in place before a doctor can perform a third-trimester abortion. Virginia law prohibits \"partial birth infanticide,\" the killing of an infant who has \"been born alive, but who has not been completely extracted or expelled from its mother.\" Northam rejected this characterization of his remarks and a spokesperson said the comments were about options for care available to women with a nonviable pregnancy or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality. In these cases, where there is \"little or no prospect\" of an infant surviving after birth, families might opt for perinatal palliative care , or comfort care \u2014 prioritizing comfort while allowing an infant to die naturally without exercising full resuscitation efforts. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes this care as existing on a spectrum of care, \"which includes pregnancy termination (abortion) and full neonatal resuscitation and treatment.\" This type of care is rare \u2014 a study of deaths at children\u2019s hospitals found that while neonates represented 41% of all deaths, perinatal palliative care was only utilized in 2% of cases \u2014 and does not meet the definition of abortion."

The post doesn\u2019t specify which states, nor does it make clear if it means the county will be stronger than the 43 states combined or compared to each. U.S. Census Bureau population estimates show that 41 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico each had fewer people than did Los Angeles County. (Perhaps whoever created the Facebook post added the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to arrive at \"43 states.\") One way to read the post is to say that Los Angeles County\u2019s influence under a direct popular vote would outweigh the combination of all 43 states. The 43 states\u2019 collective population \u2014 about 163.7 million \u2014 is about 16 times that of Los Angeles County."

That method results in about 39% of the members being millionaires. According to the Survey of Consumer Finances from the Federal Reserve Board, 12% of family economic units had $1 million or more of net wealth (all assets minus all debts), said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. We found some other analyses about how many Americans are millionaires, but none were the 1% cited in the Facebook post. Credit Suisse\u2019s Global Wealth Report showed that there are approximately 18.6 million Americans with a net worth in excess of $1 million, which works out to about 8% of the adult population. Spectrem Group found that in 2018, there were 11.8 million American households with a net worth of at least $1 million. That works out to about 5% of the adult population. But if we used income as the benchmark, the calculation for Congress would be different. The House and Senate members don\u2019t earn $1 million in their salary, but some earn investment income. For the population as a whole, IRS data for 2017 showed about 500,000 tax returns had incomes of at least $1 million. There were about 104 million tax returns filed, so that means less than 1 percent were for people who earned at least $1 million."

Obama, however, was first elected president in 2008. When we first looked into al-Baghdadi\u2019s release, the Defense Department told us the future ISIS leader was held at a U.S. detention facility in Iraq known as Camp Bucca from early February 2004 until early December 2004. There\u2019s no record of him being held at any other time. Baghdadi was not freed by the United States, either.

There\u2019s no proof he smoked marijuana to treat his ailments. A 1998 book on Mary Meyer, one of Kennedy\u2019s mistresses, recounted a 1976 National Enquirer story that said Meyer and Kennedy smoked marijuana once at the White House. The information in the article was attributed to the late Jim Pruitt, who by then was a former Washington Post editor, who said Meyer told him about the encounter. The Washington Post reported on the Enquirer article at the time. According to the Post, Pruitt confirmed his account about the marijuana smoking, said he had given the marijuana to Meyer, and he said the Enquirer had paid him for the story. But none of that goes to the idea that Kennedy regularly used marijuana at the White House in order to fight his ailments. Stacey Flores Chandler, a reference archivist at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, told us the foundation has Kennedy\u2019s medical records from the 1950s and \u201860s as well as records of several of Kennedy's physicians. \"I haven't found any evidence in either the records here or in secondary sources that the president used cannabis as a treatment for any of his medical conditions,\" she told us. Chandler also noted that historian Robert Dallek, who had access to Kennedy\u2019s medical records, wrote about amphetamines, steroids, painkillers and other medications prescribed for Kennedy\u2019s back and Addison\u2019s, but made no mention of marijuana."

The letter was meant to notify Mizzou of violations in its Confucius Institute program that were found by the department and address how to fix them. The letter states the exchange program administration attempts to help sponsors of a Confucius Institute program correct errors when the office notices them. It addressed specific areas of concern. The first area of concern was Confucius Institute student interns teaching in K-12 classrooms without a supervisor who speaks Mandarin. The language barrier \"creates a vulnerability, as efficacy of the co-teacher\u2019s supervision is severely limited,\" the letter states. The other areas of concern listed were failures to comply with required form signatures and worker\u2019s compensation policies, improperly listing Confucius Institute student interns\u2019 primary site of activity and misusing a \"Research Scholar\" role defined by the department. There is no specific mention of potential risks to students or Mizzou in the letter."

When asked to clarify how the Sanders campaign is defining the health care industry, a staffer responded that \"Bernie Sanders issued a pledge to not accept money from top officials of the insurance and pharmaceutical industries (as distinct from rank-and-file workers in those industries, which the aggregate data you cite deals with).

        "Christopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University, helped make sense of some of the figures. He calculated the average, 10-year mortality rate for flu using CDC data and found it was 0.1%. That 0.1% rate is frequently cited among experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. According to statistics released Feb. 17 by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the mortality rate for coronavirus was 2.3%. That\u2019s based on cases reported through Feb. 11 and calculated by dividing the numbers of coronavirus-related deaths at the time (1,023) by the number of the confirmed cases (44,672) of the coronavirus. But this report has limitations, Mores said, including the vague way Chinese officials are defining who has been infected by the coronavirus. \"We have not been able to understand what precisely has gone on there,\" said Mores. The WHO said in a press conference Monday that in Wuhan, China, the city where the virus first hit, the mortality rate ranged from 2% to 4%. Officials said that in the rest of China, outside of Wuhan, the mortality rate of coronavirus is 0.7%. Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the mortality rate in China has since risen to 0.9%. Right now he doesn\u2019t see a similarity in the flu mortality rate and the coronavirus mortality rate. Multiple experts told us that the number of coronavirus cases not just in China but worldwide has probably been undercounted because many people with the infection do not suffer serious symptoms and may not seek medical treatment. It is possible that only those who have tested positive are being counted as \"confirmed cases.\" Until the case definition is expanded, they said, to include people clinicians think may have COVID-19 but who were not tested for it, then the total estimated number of cases will remain lower than the likely reality. But, if the number of cases widens to include those with mild symptoms who have not been tested, then the mortality rate will go down. This is the way mortality rates are calculated for the flu, said Mores. The numbers of flu illnesses and deaths are estimates based not only on positive flu tests, but also on doctors\u2019 suspicions and symptomatic diagnosis."

The word \"dedication\" isn\u2019t included in the intro \u2014 though he does have a \"personal acknowledgments\" section where Alinsky listed his wife and editors. \"Lest we forget at least an over-the-shoulder acknowledgment to the very first radical: from all our legends, mythology, and history (and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins \u2014 or which is which), the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom \u2014 Lucifer. \u2014 SAUL ALINSKY\" His point seems to be acknowledging Lucifer in a figurative sense, rather than advocacy for satanism. The Library of Congress preserved photos of Alinsky meeting with black community organizers as well as meeting with Romney ."

Hampton Sides, author of \"Hellhound on His Trail: The Stalking of Martin Luther King Jr. and the International Hunt for His \u00adAssassin,\" told Time magazine in April 2018 that the source of many conspiracies about King\u2019s death can be traced to Ray\u2019s guilty plea, which stopped his trial from proceeding. \"There was a huge amount of evidence presented in Memphis that didn\u2019t see the light of day in a public forum,\" Sides said. \"I think that contributed to the sense of conspiracy, like a \u2018What are they hiding?\u2019 kind of thing.\" As for the actual photo in the Instagram post, it doesn\u2019t show King at St. Joseph Hospital in Memphis. It depicts King after he was stabbed on Sept. 20, 1958, in New York City.

The jury issued a verdict that said Jowers and \"others, including government agencies\" were part of a conspiracy to assassinate King. The jury awarded the Kings the $100 in damages that they sought. But in a 2000 review of the lawsuit, the Justice Department found no evidence to back up the verdict. \"Most of the witnesses and writings offered to support the various government-directed conspiracy claims relied exclusively on secondhand and thirdhand hearsay and speculation,\" the Justice Department wrote in its report on King vs. Jowers."

      "explanation": "The claim that President Trump 'fired the pandemic team' is only partially correct; there was a reorganization, and top officials involved in pandemic response left, but this is not equivalent to firing the entire pandemic team. Regarding the CDC, Trump proposed budget cuts for infectious disease programs, but these were not enacted as Congress increased funding beyond what was requested, so it's inaccurate to say he defunded the CDC.",

      "evidences": [
        "\"He fired the pandemic team two years ago\" \"Fired\" may be a strong word, but there have been abrupt changes to key national security posts with responsibility for global pandemics. More recently the administration has assigned new officials to take leadership roles. In May 2018, the top White House official in charge of the U.S. response to pandemics left the administration . After Ziemer\u2019s departure, the global health team was reorganized as part of an effort by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton. Meanwhile, Tom Bossert, a homeland security adviser who recommended strong defenses against disease and biological warfare, was reportedly pushed out by Bolton in 2018. Neither White House official or their teams, which were responsible for coordinating the U.S. response to pandemic outbreaks across agencies, have been replaced during the past two years. And on Feb. 18, 2020, a group of 27 senators sent a letter to current National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien to ask him to appoint a new global health security expert to the NSC. \"The fact that they explicitly dismantled the office in the White House that was tasked with preparing for exactly this kind of a risk is hugely concerning,\" Jeremy Konyndyk, who ran foreign disaster assistance in the Obama administration, told the Guardian . \"Both the structure and all the institutional memory is gone now.\" Instead, Trump has looked within his administration to fill roles for the coronavirus response. Last month, Trump appointed his Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar, to chair a coronavirus task force. It\u2019s not accurate to say that Trump has been \"defunding\" the CDC, but he has tried to make cuts in key programs. The Trump administration\u2019s initial proposals for the budgets for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases at CDC \u2014 a key player in the fight against coronavirus \u2014 have consistently been lower than what was spent the previous year. The administration proposed $61.7 million less in 2018 than 2017; $96.4 million less in 2019 than in 2018; $114.4 million less in 2020 than in 2019; and $85.3 million less in 2021 than 2020. However, Congress reshapes presidential recommendations as they see fit when they craft final spending bills. Every year since Trump has been president, lawmakers have passed bills \u2014 bills signed by Trump \u2014 that not only exceeded what Trump requested on emerging infections but also exceeded what had been spent the previous year. As the chart below shows, funding increased every year from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2020."

Experts agree with Napolitano Frank Bowman , a University of Missouri professor of law and author of \" High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump ,\" told us the hearings are not \"secret\" in that they are open to members of the three House committees (roughly 100 lawmakers), along with their staff. Bowman pointed us to the 2015 House rules that allow for the private questioning of witnesses in impeachment inquiries. The rules say House meetings shall be open to the public except when a committee or subcommittee, in open session and with a majority present, \"determines by record vote that all or part of the remainder of the meeting on that day shall be in executive session because disclosure of matters to be considered would endanger national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person, or otherwise would violate a law or rule of the House.\""

        "The evidence When asked to provide backup, American Family spokesman Ken Muth pointed us to \" The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness ,\" a 2010 book by civil rights lawyer Michelle Alexander. In the introduction to the book, the author writes \"we have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it.\" Alexander goes on to say : \"More African American adults are under correctional control today\u2014in prison or jail, on probation or parole \u2014 than were enslaved in 1850, a decade before the Civil War began.\" That item noted: \"The U.S. Census Bureau records for 1850 showed that 872,924 male African American slaves over age 15 lived in the United States at that time. Meanwhile, federal Bureau of Justice statistics statistics showed about 1.68 million African American men were under state and federal criminal justice supervision. Salzwedel\u2019s statement was worded a bit differently, in that it referred broadly to the \"penal system.\" When taken broadly, we think that takes in those on probation and parole, as well as those in the nation\u2019s local jails. The latest available nationwide data on parole and probation is from 2016, so we\u2019ll zoom in there. At the end of 2016, there were 487,300 black men serving time in state or federal prison and about 200,000 serving time in local jails, according to the BJS report \" Jail Inmates in 2016 .\" The agency also recorded 771,355 on probation and 289,000 on parole. That means about 1.75 million black men were under federal, state and local criminal justice supervision. That is about double the 872,924 black men who were enslaved in 1850."

        "During the Nixon and Clinton impeachment hearings, the majority and minority parties could seek subpoenas, and both of them could lodge an objection to the other\u2019s request. The text of the rules for both the Nixon and Clinton hearings was the same (bold emphasis is ours): The power to issue a subpoena \"may be exercised by the chairman and the ranking minority member acting jointly, or, if either declines to act, by the other acting alone, except that in the event either so declines, either shall have the right to refer to the committee for decision the question whether such authority shall be so exercised.\" Of course, if it came to a committee vote, by definition, the majority has the votes to win. In contrast, the rule approved for the Trump impeachment effectively says the Democrats can object to a Republican request, but the Republicans can\u2019t object to a Democratic one. The business of \"either shall have the right\" is missing in the current rules. \"Under the Clinton and Nixon rules, it was symmetrical,\" said Stanford law professor Dave Alan Sklansky. \"Now there\u2019s an asymmetry.\" But again, both then and now, if it comes to a committee vote, the majority will get what it wants. And for the witnesses Republicans want, they face the same potential hurdle they faced back in 1974 and 1998. 2: Access to records Cole misrepresents the issue of member access to materials in the Trump impeachment inquiry, and he\u2019s wrong about what took place in the Nixon investigation. He said the resolution doesn\u2019t \"guarantee\" that all members have access to hearing materials. But his staff could point to no document or statement from the Democrats that denied access. His office told us \"the concern is that current chairmen are not respecting\" standing House rules. The Democratic materials say nothing about this one way or the other. Compared with the Nixon process , lawmakers imposed strict limits on who could see what. Clinton\u2019s lawyers did participate in the Judiciary Committee process, and the House resolution gives Trump\u2019s lawyers the same rights for that committee. However, Cole has a point that Trump\u2019s lawyers can\u2019t participate in the House committees currently investigating the president, most importantly, the Select Intelligence Committee. In the Trump investigation, Republicans on the Intelligence Committee can call witnesses and ask questions. They don\u2019t have the same powers as the majority, but they have the right to participate and represent Trump\u2019s interests. Once it gets to the Judiciary Committee, the House resolution grants Trump and his lawyers more rights than Clinton or Nixon enjoyed."

Bloomberg\u2019s claim wasn\u2019t limited to Texas, but this trend is also visible at the state level. A 2018 report from the CDC looked at infant mortality data from 2013 to 2015 by state and race and found that, in Texas, the mortality rate for infants born to non-Hispanic white women was 5 deaths per 1,000 live births and was 10.52 for infants born to black women. The five leading causes of all infant deaths in 2017 identified by the CDC were all health related: Congenital malformations: 21% of infant deaths Disorders related to short gestation and low birthweight: 17% of infant deaths Maternal complications: 6% of infant deaths Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): 6% of infant deaths Unintentional injuries: 6% of infant deaths In a 2019 report, the CDC noted that infants born to black women had the highest mortality rates for disorders related to short gestation (premature birth) and low birthweight and maternal complications. Numerous academic studies and media investigations have highlighted correlations between access to health care and the disparity in infant and maternal mortality rates between black and white mothers. But access to health care is widely considered to be one of many contributing factors. One 2017 study published in the American Journal of Public Health identified other factors that contribute to the high black infant mortality rate: socioeconomic status, maternal behavior, \"exposure to protective and risk factors over the course of a woman\u2019s life,\" and certain historical factors like segregation, limited educational opportunities, structural racism, and intergenerational poverty. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2019 explored how state Medicaid expansion associated with changes in low birthweight and preterm birth across different races \u2014 which are more likely to affect black mothers and infants than white mothers and infants."

        "The picture used in the post does include a man named Evan Duke who appears to support the antifa movement. But Duke and an antifa group in Portland, Ore., told PolitiFact that Duke does not lead antifa nor Occupy ICE. Origin of the picture in the Facebook post The Facebook photo features Gabbard and seven other people. Gabbard, a congresswoman from Hawaii and a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, posted a similar picture of the group on her Facebook page on Dec. 10, 2016. She described the people in the image as a group of veterans helping with safety and security operations at a camp protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline . The Hallwalls caption for the photo identified one of the men as \"Evan Duke (Occupy Wall St.)\" Who is Evan Duke? PolitiFact reached out to that account, and the user confirmed he was in the picture being shared on Facebook. Duke\u2019s account includes antifa-related posts, but he said he was not the leader of antifa nor of Occupy ICE. PolitiFact reached out to a group called Rose City Antifa (whose website said it was founded in 2007 in Portland, Ore.) asking if Duke was the \"leader of Portland Antifa and Occupy ICE,\" as the Facebook post claimed. \"Evan Duke is not the leader of Portland Antifa, he is not a member of our organization, and he is not the leader of Occupy ICE,\" the group responded in an email. They said he had never been the leader of the groups, either."

      "statement": "\"\"Yet, for all that spending, health outcomes today on Medicaid are mediocre and many patients have difficulty accessing care.\u201d\"",
      "explanation": "The claim suggests that health outcomes for Medicaid patients are mediocre and that many have difficulty accessing care. The evidence shows a mix of findings: while Medicaid recipients may report lower health status compared to those with private insurance and have some difficulties accessing specialists, the evidence also points to improved access to care and positive health outcomes for those on Medicaid compared to being uninsured. Studies indicate Medicaid expansion is linked to positive health outcomes, contradicting the notion of mediocrity in outcomes. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the evidence.",

        "A CMS spokesperson responded by pointing us to a CMS fact sheet comparing the health status of people on Medicaid to people with private insurance and Medicare. The fact sheet, among other things, showed 43% of Medicaid enrollees report their health as excellent or very good compared with 71% of people with private insurance, 14% on Medicare and 58% who were uninsured. The spokesperson also pointed to a 2017 report by the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC), a congressional advisory board, that noted: \"Medicaid enrollees have more difficulty than low-income privately insured individuals in finding a doctor who accepts their insurance and making an appointment; Medicaid enrollees also have more difficulty finding a specialist physician who will treat them.\" Several national Medicaid experts said Verma is wrong to use health status as a proxy for whether Medicaid helps improve health for people. That\u2019s because to be eligible for Medicaid, people must fall into a low-income bracket, which can impact their health in many ways. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard University, said Verma\u2019s comparison of the health status of Medicaid recipients against people with Medicare or private insurance is invalid because the populations are so different and face varied health risks. For a better mechanism to gauge health outcomes under Medicaid, experts point to dozens of studies that track what happened in states that chose in the past six years to pursue the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion. \"Most research demonstrates that Medicaid expansion has improved access to care, utilization of services, the affordability of care, and financial security among the low-income population,\" concluded the Kaiser Family Foundation in summarizing findings from more than 300 studies. \"Studies show improved self-reported health following expansion and an association between expansion and certain positive health outcomes.\" Studies found the expansion of Medicaid led to lower mortality rates for people with heart disease and among end-stage renal disease patients initiating dialysis . Researchers also reported that Medicaid expansion was associated with declines in the length of stay of hospitalized patients. A 2017 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found 84% of Medicaid recipients felt they were able to get all the medical care they needed in the previous six months. Only 3% said they could not get care because of long wait times or because doctors would not accept their insurance. Verma cites a 2017 MACPAC report that noted some people on Medicaid have issues accessing care. But that report also noted: \"The body of work to date by MACPAC and others shows that Medicaid beneficiaries have much better access to care, and much higher health care utilization, than individuals without insurance, particularly when controlling for socioeconomic characteristics and health status.\" It also notes that \"Medicaid beneficiaries also fare as well as or better than individuals with private insurance on some access measures.\" The report said people with Medicaid are as likely as those with private insurance to have a usual source of care, a doctor visit each year and certain services such as a Pap test to detect cervical cancer. On the negative side, the report said Medicaid recipients are more likely than privately insured patients to experience longer waiting times to see a doctor. They also are less likely to receive mammograms, colorectal tests and dental visits than the privately insured. \"Compared to having no insurance at all, having Medicaid improves access to care and improves health,\" said Rachel Garfield, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"There is pretty strong evidence that Medicaid helps patients get the care they need.\""

        "This conspiracy theory is an overreach of a system that the UN is using to help identify refugees through biometrics that include facial recognition, fingerprints and iris scans. The agenda comprises 17 goals to achieve around the world by 2030 and includes objectives like no poverty, zero hunger and quality education. The section in question, 16.9, says: \"By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration.\" The idea , though, was to help refugees prove their identities when seeking asylum, and biometrics refers to many different types of identification (not just microchips). When operational, the tool will provide refugees with the ability to present their IDs via an app on their smartphones at border crossings to prove they`re coming from a refugee camp and qualify for aid. Since then, biometric technology has been developed to help identify refugee populations (though there have been some concerns about the practice). But the claim that the UN is planning to implant the world\u2019s population with a microchip ID is far off. We found no mention of implanted microchips in the UN\u2019s goals. Even if UN-backed biometric technology is aimed to expand beyond refugee and immigrant populations, this theory is based on speculation and overblows the facts."

        "In July 2019, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a news release about proposed new rules for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps. The release said the proposed rule \"would fix a loophole that has expanded SNAP recipients in some states to include people who receive assistance when they clearly don\u2019t need it.\" Reviews of their income and assets would need to be conducted to ensure that, in most cases, their income is at or below 130% of the federal poverty level and they do not have liquid assets worth more than $2,250. For a family of three, 130% of the federal poverty level is about $2,250 a month. Nationwide, the proposal is expected to save $2.5 billion and cut benefits to about 3 million people. The evidence When asked to provide backup, Grothman\u2019s staff pointed us to several news articles, including a Sept. 16, 2019 report from the Washington Examiner that reminded readers about the case of Leroy Fick who continued to receive food stamps after winning $2 million in the Michigan State Lottery in 2010. \"Fick used his winnings to buy a new home and an Audi convertible, all while continuing to receive SNAP benefits,\" the Examiner article said. At the time, Michigan used federal guidelines that based eligibility for food stamps solely on income. The state considered Fick\u2019s $850,000 lump sum lottery payment an asset -- not income. So, under state policy then in effect, Fick could legally get food stamps. The state subsequently banned anyone with assets of more than $5,000, excluding a car, from the food stamp program. That ban knocked Fick off the food stamp rolls. Cloud (Minn.) Times, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, Undersander said he and his wife have a net worth that \"exceeds $1 million.\" In that and other accounts, he said he wanted to expose a loophole that would allow people who are wealthy, or at least those not needy, to qualify for food stamps. Undersander said he gave the money he received to charity When his case was described at a June 20, 2019 House agriculture subcommittee , the story ignited a partisan firestorm."

      "explanation": "The claim that violent crime in South Bend doubled during Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s tenure is not supported by the evidence. The apparent increase in reported violent crime was due to a change in how crimes, particularly aggravated assaults, were counted by the South Bend police. Before 2016, certain assaults where a weapon was shown or implied were not counted as aggravated assaults. This change falsely inflated the numbers, as noted by data analyst Jeff Asher and the FBI. Therefore, the observed spike in violent crime statistics does not reflect an actual increase in violent crime during Mayor Pete's tenure.",

In 2016, based on advice from the FBI, South Bend police changed how it counted aggravated assaults \u2014 and the number of violent crimes reported by South Bend spiked, exceeding 1,000 in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the most recent year for which figures are available. Previously, South Bend had not been counting instances where a weapon was shown or implied as an aggravated assault, said Jeff Asher, data analyst and consultant at AH Datalytics who has written in the New York Times about violent crime in South Bend. \"The evidence is telling us that South Bend didn\u2019t become more violent; it simply changed how it counted assaults,\" he wrote. The FBI noted the issue in comparing annual totals in South Bend from 2016 forward this way:\u00a0 \"Because of changes in\" South Bend's \"reporting practices, figures are not comparable to previous years' data.\""

We reviewed Nexis news archives for coverage of Cosby\u2019s efforts to buy the network, and found that talk of any possible deal appears to have dissipated after 1993, when the Associated Press characterized Cosby\u2019s interest as \"short-lived.\" The New York Times also said that the asking price for NBC at the time was likely to be around $4 billion when Cosby\u2019s net worth was estimated at $300 million."

During the 2017-2018 school year, the latest year for which the group has updated figures, Chicago ranked 22nd out of 124 for its starting salary. Chicago\u2019s ranking improved for teachers with more years of teaching and higher education credentials, according to the center\u2019s analysis. For example, a teacher with a master\u2019s degree and 10 years of job experience made more under Chicago\u2019s salary schedule than their counterparts in all but two of the districts included in the group\u2019s database. Even so, Lightfoot didn\u2019t constrain her remarks to the nation\u2019s 100-plus largest districts either. And salary schedules are different than the average compensation a teacher in a given district actually receives. \"A salary schedule really doesn\u2019t tell you what the reality is on the ground,\" said Robert Bruno, a labor expert at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, adding that it doesn\u2019t say how many teachers are actually making that pay.

Chicago Public Schools came out 109th of the state\u2019s more than 800 school districts based on average teacher pay alone.

        "\"They\u2019re trying to provide some sense of the relative impact on drug development, but I don\u2019t think we have enough data to provide this,\" said Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University. \"It\u2019s not a fact. It\u2019s a preliminary estimate that is on very shaky ground.\" The CBO estimates that, over the next decade, between eight and 15 fewer drugs would come to market. But the big picture matters: Every year, the Food and Drug Administration approves 30 new drugs, on average. That\u2019s 300 new drugs over 10 years. So if you assume 15 fewer drugs out of 300 projected approvals, that\u2019s a loss of 5%. Certainly that is, as PhRMA argued, a reduction. But none of the experts we spoke with saw it as a blow to innovation. \"The lower prices envisioned by [Pelosi\u2019s] bill would barely slow new drug discovery at all,\" argued Dr. Peter Bach, who directs the Drug Pricing Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in an op-ed for Bloomberg . In fact, she said, \"there is a good reason to believe that the drugs you would lose are those that have the smallest benefit and highest price tag.\" This gets at another point: A substantial portion of drug research and development isn\u2019t actually done by drugmakers. The riskiest portions often are conducted in government-funded labs, noted Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor at Harvard Medical School who studies pharmaceutical policy. Drug companies get involved much later, making it even less certain that a loss in pharmaceutical revenue would meaningfully discourage breakthrough drug innovation. Other arguments PhRMA also pointed us to a Dec. 3 report put out by the White House Council of Economic Advisers . It found a much higher impact \u2015 arguing that H.R.3 would result in \"as many as 100 fewer drugs\" entering the American market in the next 10 years. The CEA number rests on a series of assumptions. But experts called this analysis suspect at best. Dusetzina also noted that the analysis doesn\u2019t consider the increased revenue drug companies might experience from more people being able to afford drugs and therefore buy them."

Consequently, the protections provided to Trump before this committee differ from those afforded to previous presidents, as no preliminary hearings by another committee took place for them. Expert opinions support the view that Trump does not have the same due process protections in this stage as Clinton and Nixon did not have such processes either.

Just as Nixon wasn\u2019t involved in the investigation preceding his impeachment proceedings. Sarah Binder , professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the liberal Brookings Institute, called it an apples and oranges comparison. \"I think it's fair to think of the (Intelligence Committee) investigation as the rough equivalent to those behind-closed-door Clinton and Nixon investigations,\" Binder said in an email. In other words, those presidents didn\u2019t have any due process protections at that stage that are now withheld from Trump. On Trump and due process Steil\u2019s team is correct that the ability to punish Trump for a lack of cooperation is novel, Binder said. Here\u2019s the description of that point from the Congressional Record : Should the President unlawfully refuse to make witnesses available for testimony to, or to produce documents requested by, the investigative committees ... the chair shall have the discretion to impose appropriate remedies, including by denying specific requests by the President or his counsel under these procedures to call or question witnesses. But Binder questioned whether it\u2019s fair to summarize that as not having due process protections. \"It doesn't per se mean \u2026 that President Trump has fewer procedural protections than did his predecessors,\" Binder said in an email. \"It does mean that should the president fail to cooperate, he could be penalized by the committee for such behavior.\""

They do paint a picture of leaders fearful of Russia and of Trump\u2019s comments that took a more conciliatory stance on Russian aggression."

While some animal studies suggest potential priming effects, these are not directly translatable to humans. Moreover, the evidence indicates that both alcohol and nicotine have similar impacts.

        "We contacted the surgeon general\u2019s office, which directed us to statements from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. NIDA noted that marijuana may have a gateway effect, but that most people who use the drug don\u2019t progress to other, harder substances; and that alcohol and nicotine appear to have a similar impact. The idea that marijuana can \"prime your brain for addiction\" has some basis: namely, the results of some studies conducted with rodents. For instance, Adams\u2019 office noted that preclinical studies indicate exposure to THC \u2013 marijuana\u2019s main psychoactive compound \u2013\u00a0 during a period roughly equivalent to adolescence in rats resulted in greater self-administration of heroin when the animals reach adulthood. In addition, THC exposure yielded changes in their brains\u2019 reward system \u2013 in other words, yes, priming the brain for the rewarding effects of opioids. But, Isen said, it\u2019s scientifically problematic to draw a line from the effects seen in rodents to what might be happening to a human. \"We should remain agnostic about the surgeon general\u2019s claim,\" Isen argued. Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa., took a more optimistic view of that research, arguing that the animal evidence is \"very clear\" when it comes to marijuana\u2019s neurological impact. \"What we know is strong enough to say that exposure during adolescence when the brain is developing is a risk,\" said Susan Weiss, a scientific adviser to the NIDA director. But how meaningful of a risk \u2013 and how it compares to other drugs \u2013 is exceptionally tough to say, given the limitations on research. Studies on actual humans are limited because people who use marijuana at a young age may be exposed to other risk factors, such as peer influences using harder drugs, or sociodemographic factors that might predispose them to abuse or addiction. As Dr. Sue Sisley, an Arizona-based psychiatrist who tracks the state of marijuana research, put it: \"I don\u2019t see very much good, rigorous data to confirm either way.\" In the most narrow sense, marijuana indeed has a \"unique\" effect on the brain. It elicits a response from what are called \"endocannabinoid receptors.\" Other drugs don\u2019t \u2013 they interact with different brain receptors. On a practical level, Isen said, while one could highlight the distinct scientific effect marijuana has, \"there is no evidence that marijuana has a uniquely deleterious effect on the developing brain - certainly not more than other substances such as alcohol.\""

Bringing literacy to Cuba\u2019s peasants was a long-standing policy in Castro\u2019s broader agenda. In his 1957 manifesto , he included: \"Immediate initiation of an intensive campaign against illiteracy, and civic education emphasizing the duties and rights of each citizen to his society and fatherland.\" In 1961, about a quarter of a million teachers fanned out across the island nation. Their ranks included formally trained teachers and members of such groups as the National \u00a0 Federation of Sugar Workers, the Rebel Youth Association and the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces.

That didn\u2019t pan out: Millions of Americans\u2019 plans were canceled, spawning months of controversy. He suggests many Americans would be able to pick between buying private insurance or opting into the government plan. But does that mean that if you like your plan, you can keep it? The problem is that private insurance availability isn\u2019t up to the government. To be sure, state and federal regulators have the power to dictate, for example, the inclusion of certain benefits and to set basic consumer protections. But the government cannot specifically require insurance companies to offer plans, and any carrier has the option to stop providing coverage. Already, market forces dictate what health insurance is available from year to year. It\u2019s impossible to predict, but a competing public option might change the financial incentives for those plans and push some of those carriers to abandon the exchange. If that happened, people using that plan would lose the insurance they have, regardless of how they feel about it. So, she added, suggesting that people who like their private plans will have the option to keep them under Buttigieg\u2019s proposal is \"probably not true.\" In 2019, 53% of employers providing coverage considered changing the plan or the carrier they offered, according to a KFF survey . Of that group, almost a fifth \u2014 18% \u2015 ultimately did change insurance carriers. That flux would likely increase under a plan like Buttigieg\u2019s."

        "Dennis Winters, chief economist for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, said the best metric to use in examining the claim is median wages \u2014 and, of course, to examine them in \"real\" terms, to compare the spending power over time. The median wage for Americans in December 1990 was $417 per week, which breaks down to $10.43 an hour. Fast-forward three decades, and the median wage for Americans in December 2019 was $933 per week, or $23.33 an hour. That might look like a significant increase. But using the Bureau\u2019s inflation calculator, the 1990 weekly wage translates to $800.88 per week in today\u2019s dollars, or $20.02 an hour. So, that\u2019s a roughly $3 increase in 30 years. From a narrow perspective, Pocan is off \u2014 an offer of $12.75 does not equate to hourly wages from 30 years ago, as a straight comparison or with inflation factored in. He fares much better when considering the larger point being made: That wage growth has been largely stagnant. An August 2018 study from the Pew Research Center showed that at least since 2000, most of the country\u2019s wage growth is distributed among the top 10% of earners. For those closer to the median and below it, the growth line is nearly flat. What\u2019s more, the cost of living has undergone a much steeper hike: from 1983 to 2013, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a roughly 3% annual increase in rent and food prices, and a 1.3% annual increase in new vehicle prices. So, a small growth in median wages is dwarfed next to the rise in cost of other goods."

        "Biden did call for Ukraine to fire Shokin, but the ad fails to note that there were widespread calls for his ouster. Biden assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine after a popular revolution in early 2014 that led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Shokin became top prosecutor in 2015, after Yanukovych went into exile. A frustrated Biden in Dec. 2015 threatened to withhold $1 billion unless Shokin was fired, in hopes that a new prosecutor would do more to enforce the law. According to Biden, it worked. When Shokin was fired in the spring of 2016, press reports explicitly linked his ouster to corruption. Steven Pifer, a career foreign service officer who held positions in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, previously told PolitiFact that \"virtually everyone\" he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine \"felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired.\" \"All decent people were in favor of Shokin's sacking,\" Anders \u00c5slund, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council told PolitiFact. \"Biden led a Western/anticorruption consensus.\" Recently, Shokin said in a statement that his refusal to formally close the investigations led to his ouster. But Vitaliy Kasko, who served as Shokin\u2019s deputy overseeing international cooperation until he resigned in protest, told Bloomberg in 2019 that, under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma remained dormant. Kasko said the matter was \"shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015,\" and Bloomberg reported that documents backed up his account. Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry The ad says that \"Democrats want to impeach President Trump for discussing this investigation with Ukraine's President.\" The ad soft-pedals Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 by describing it merely as a discussion. The ad omits that a summary of the call shows Trump encouraging Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, and Attorney General William Barr and \"look into\" Biden. Before the call, Trump froze $400 million in aid to Ukraine. The hold on the money was lifted Sept. 11."

The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis put the size of the U.S. economy at $21.4 trillion in 2019. Using Buttigieg\u2019s estimate of the revenue gap, his statement is mathematically correct, but it ignores the different time frames. For a more apples-to-apples comparison (which would come with a host of other analytic issues), you would look at the cumulative value of the economy as projected by the Congressional Budget Office over the next decade. The CBO\u2019s latest estimate amounts to nearly $300 trillion worth of GDP by 2030. In that context, a budget hole of $25 trillion adds up to about 8% of the total."

Here\u2019s what happened, according to the Tampa Bay Times : When Gaetz was 26, he was driving back from a nightclub on Okaloosa Island in a BMW registered to his father, then-Florida Sen. Don Gaetz. Okaloosa County Deputy Chris Anglin clocked Gaetz traveling 48 mph in a 35 mph. Anglin reported that Gaetz\u2019s eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he swayed and staggered when he got out of the car and smelled of alcohol. Gaetz, a lawyer, admitted he had consumed two beers but declined field sobriety tests. He was arrested and refused the breath test. We did not find evidence that Gaetz\u2019s father Don \"got him off\" of the arrest, as the post says. Gaetz\u2019s lawyer filed a motion to drop the case. The prosecutor agreed to drop the case in December 2008, court records show . Florida Department of Law Enforcement records note only one arrest for Gaetz, in October 2008, related to a DUI misdemeanor traffic offense. Snopes , which debunked a meme about Gaetz\u2019s DUI record in July, found that the earliest version of the claim stemmed from a 2016 post by a conspiracy theorist . Vitas fraud case didn\u2019t involve Matt Gaetz The Facebook post goes on to say \"he was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud.\" That leaves the impression that \"he\" refers to Matt Gaetz, which is wrong. It was Don Gaetz\u2019s former company, Vitas Healthcare Corporation, that was involved in litigation involving fraud. It didn\u2019t involve Matt Gaetz, and the elder Gaetz was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit. In 2013, the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Chemed Corporation and hospice subsidiaries, including Vitas Hospice Services LLC and Vitas Healthcare Corporation, alleging false Medicare billings for hospice services. Gaetz was not named as a defendant and denied wrongdoing ."

      "explanation": "While Pelosi claims Republicans get more rights, the evidence shows a mixed picture. There are more committees involved than in past impeachments, but some committees have smaller roles now. Republicans have equal time to question witnesses, which is similar to past proceedings, but they lack power to challenge subpoenas, unlike in past impeachments. The practical impact of this imbalance is not significant since the majority party generally controls committee decisions. Thus, the claim is partially correct but overstated.",
      "label": "NOT_SUPPORTED",
      "evidences": [
        "Pelosi\u2019s claim that Republicans are getting more rights comes down to two measures: the number of lawmakers involved, and their power to call witnesses and ask them questions. On the first, Pelosi\u2019s staff say there are twice as many committees involved and so, twice as many minority party lawmakers. That is accurate compared with past impeachments, however, compared with what has taken place so far, the resolution\u2019s focus on the two committees means that several other committees will now play smaller roles. Many Republicans on committees such as Oversight and Foreign Affairs have been able to participate when key witnesses testified. They will lose that under this resolution. For the Nixon and Clinton proceedings, all the action was in the House Judiciary Committee. The rules laid out in the House resolution and by the Judiciary Committee chair give Republicans equal time to question witnesses. It does so in more detail than in the Nixon and Clinton House resolutions. In 1974 and 1998 , members of both parties could call witnesses. Either side could object to a witness, in which case, the dispute would ultimately be resolved by committee vote. Today, the Republicans lack the power to challenge a Democratic subpoena. The practical impact is less telling, because in the past as in the present, the majority party always has the votes to win at the committee level."

While Washington Times data initially implied this by comparing 56 subpoenas to 46 bills signed into law, it overlooks the over 500 bills the House actually passed. The evidence clearly shows more bills have been passed than subpoenas issued, although most bills haven't become law due to the separate legislative processes involving the Senate.

        "The claim has roots in an Oct. 22 article from the Washington Times , which said that under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Democrats have issued 56 subpoenas while passing just 46 bills that went on to become laws. But while other Republicans specified that the Washington Times article counted congressional subpoenas against House bills that were ultimately signed into law, Shields was less precise, instead comparing subpoenas issued to bills passed. In fact, House Democrats have helped pass more than 500 bills and resolutions, although many have not made their way to Trump\u2019s desk. When we reached out to Shields, he said he \"misspoke,\" and he later clarified his point on Twitter . \"I meant to say more subpoenas than laws that have been passed, not bills,\" he told us. Experts said it\u2019s meaningless to compare subpoenas with House bills enacted into law, because while a committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, there are more hurdles when it comes to legislation. The House can\u2019t make laws by itself Experts said the biggest problem with the subpoenas-to-bills comparison is the lack of attention it pays to the Senate\u2019s role in sending House-backed bills to the president\u2019s desk. \"The House can't pass \u2018bills into law\u2019 by itself,\" said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. According to Congress.gov , the House has passed or agreed to 522 bills and resolutions since January. \"We are talking about two completely different processes,\" said Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, a Washington think tank. \"A committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, whereas it takes a majority of House members and senators to enact a law."

Tara Sinclair, an economics professor at George Washington University, said average growth rates for business investment look stronger in recent years, but when measured as a share of Gross Domestic Product the picture is very similar under both administrations. Sinclair said GOP policies that cut regulations may have helped lead to stronger business investment under the Trump administration, but it\u2019s hard to blame or credit a presidential administration for most economic outcomes. \"As you can see from the data, the quarterly growth rates are quite volatile, so more data to identify a clear trend will be helpful,\" Sinclair told us."

Other states give private sellers the option of going through law enforcement directly for the background check. The record-keeping requirements vary, with some states leaving that to the individual selling the gun and others requiring transfers be reported to local law enforcement. The state Department of Justice handles background checks for handgun sales , while long gun sales go through the National Criminal Background Check Systems , run by the FBI. The FBI conducts the background check but is required by federal law to destroy identifying information on the purchaser and gun within 24 hours. So under a comprehensive system, serial numbers would \u2014 eventually \u2014 make it to a government agency. But it is typically decades before that happens, and the agency is then prohibited from turning those into a database. Would a gun registry violate the Second Amendment?

From Aug. 1, 2018, to Aug. 31 of this year, there were 6,182 bookings into the county jail on new DWI arrests. Of those arrests, 7.4% of those individuals had an ICE detainer. Of all the DWI cases that went before the court in fiscal year 2018, about 20% involved people who were not U.S. citizens. It\u2019s unclear what percentage of that group were people who were in the country illegally."

        "Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff knew more about the makings of a whistleblower complaint against President Donald Trump than he let on, according to reporting from the New York Times. But Republicans, including Trump, who have seized on the Times reporting have erred in claiming the reporting suggests Schiff helped write the complaint itself. The Times did not report that Schiff helped write, or devised the complaint. The Times reporting, which relied on anonymous sources and has been corroborated by the Washington Post, shows that the whistleblower approached one of Schiff\u2019s aides with only a vague accusation against Trump. The aide told the CIA officer to find a lawyer and then told Schiff some of what the whistleblower told them. The aide did not share the officer\u2019s identity with Schiff. What the whistleblower and Schiff say Schiff did receive some information about the whistleblower complaint before it was formally presented to Congress. But both the House Intelligence Committee and a lawyer representing the whistleblower told us the complaint was drafted independently of Schiff\u2019s input, and we could find no evidence to the contrary. At the same time, Trump and Republicans have produced no evidence to suggest Schiff had helped draft or shape the complaint. He said he also can\u2019t comment on what Schiff knew about the whistleblower\u2019s concerns, but that the officer \"drafted the complaint entirely on their own.\" \"To be unequivocally clear, no member or congressional staff had any input into or reviewed the complaint before it was submitted to the intelligence community inspector general. Nor has the whistleblower or the legal team met with or even discussed this complaint with congressman Schiff.\""
